```python
from datetime import timedelta

def calculate_charge(date, quantity, winter_rate, summer_rate, winter_service_charge, summer_start, summer_end):
    if date < summer_start or date > summer_end:
        charge = quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge
    else:
        charge = quantity * summer_rate
    
    return charge
```
Here's how the refactored code works:
- We define a function called `calculate_charge` that takes in six arguments: the date, quantity, winter rate, summer rate, winter service charge, and the start and end of summer.
- Inside the function, we use an if-else statement to check if the date is before or after the summer start/end dates.
- If the date is before or after the summer start/end dates, then we calculate the charge as the quantity multiplied by the winter rate plus the winter service charge. 
- Otherwise, if the date is within the summer period, we calculate the charge as the quantity multiplied by the summer rate.
- Finally, the function returns the calculated charge.
