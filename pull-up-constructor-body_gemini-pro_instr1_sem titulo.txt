```python
class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name, id, grade):
        super().__init__(name, id)
        self.grade = grade


# Example of usage:

manager = Manager("John Smith", 12345, 9)
```

**Enhancements:**

* **Encapsulation**: The `__init__` method of the `Manager` class now uses `super()` to invoke the `__init__` method of the base class `Employee`. This ensures that the common initialization logic is handled in one place, making the code more maintainable.

* **Modularity**: The `grade` attribute is now initialized separately from the `name` and `id` attributes. This makes it easier to add or modify the initialization logic for the `grade` attribute in the future.

* **Readability**: The code is now more readable and easier to understand, thanks to the use of clear and concise variable names and comments.

* **Maintainability**: The use of `super()` and the modular initialization logic makes the code easier to maintain and extend in the future.
