Refactoring the code to improve readability, modularity and maintainability you should implement a function where you encapsulate the logic of getting the billing plan for a customer. Here's one way to do it:

```python
def get_customer_billing_plan(customer):
    if customer is None:
        return BillingPlan.basic()
    else:
        return customer.getPlan()
```  

And use it as:

```python
plan = get_customer_billing_plan(customer)
```  

This way, if the logic of getting a billing plan changes later it will be easier to maintain as changes will be required in only one place, i.e., inside the function.
