One way to refactor this code is to extract the checking of the balance into a separate function and pass it as an argument to the `withdraw` function. This will make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. Here's an example:
```scss
def check_balance(self, amount):
    if amount > self.balance:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0

def withdraw(self, amount):
    balance = check_balance(amount)
    if balance == -1:
        return -1
    else:
        self.balance -= amount
    return 0
```
