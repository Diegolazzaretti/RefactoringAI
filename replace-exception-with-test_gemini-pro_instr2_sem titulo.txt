To enhance the code's readability, modularity, and maintainability, the code can be refactored as follows:

```python
class ValueProvider:

    def __init__(self, values):
        self.values = values

    def get_value(self, period_number):
        try:
            return self.values[period_number]
        except IndexError:
            return 0
```

The following changes were made to the code:

* The code was refactored to use a class, which makes it more modular and easier to maintain.
* The exception handling was moved to the `get_value()` method, which makes the code more concise and easier to read.
* The name of the function was changed to `get_value()` to make it more descriptive.
* The name of the variable `values` was changed to `self.values` to make it more clear that it is a member variable of the class.

These changes contribute to the improvements by:

* Reducing code duplication: The exception handling code was moved to the `get_value()` method, which eliminates the need to repeat the same code in multiple places.
* Simplifying the logic: The code was simplified by moving the exception handling to the `get_value()` method, which makes the code easier to read and understand.
* Improving overall organization: The code was organized into a class, which makes it more modular and easier to maintain.
