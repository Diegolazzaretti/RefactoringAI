gpt-4 - Instrução 1 com titulo:

Here is the refactored code:

```python
class PizzaDelivery:
    FIVE_LATE_DELIVERIES = 5
    HIGH_RATING = 2
    LOW_RATING = 1

    # ...

    def get_rating(self):
        if self.more_than_five_late_deliveries():
            return self.HIGH_RATING
        else:
            return self.LOW_RATING
  
    def more_than_five_late_deliveries(self):
        return self.numberOfLateDeliveries > self.FIVE_LATE_DELIVERIES
```

Changes made:

1. Renamed the methods from camelCase to snake_case for consistency with Python's naming conventions.
2. Replaced magic numbers with descriptive constant variables to improve readability.
3. Improved the `get_rating` function to make it more readable by replacing the ternary operator with a full if-else statement. This comes down to personal preference though: some people may prefer the conciseness of the ternary operator.
4. Inserted a placeholder comment (`# ...`) where other class methods would go to indicate that other methods might be present in the actual class.
