After refactoring, the code now adheres to the best practices of software development and is more modular, maintainable, and readable. Here are the changes that were made:

1. Extract the common state variables (health, damage, and weaponStatus) into a base class, so they don't need to be repeated in every derived class. This makes the code more modular and maintainable.
2. Extract the methods that operate on these common state variables (getDamage() and attack()) into a base class as well. This ensures that the derived classes only contain methods specific to their behavior, making them simpler and easier to understand.
3. Derive new classes from the base Soldier class, each with its own unique behavior. This makes the code more flexible and allows for easy extension in the future.
4. Use appropriate naming conventions for variables and methods, such as camelCase and snake\_case, respectively. This improves readability and makes it easier to understand the code.
5. Use proper indentation and spacing to make the code more visually appealing and easier to read.
6. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the code, making it easier for others to understand and modify the code in the future.
