**Refactored Code:**

```python
def printOwing(self):
    self._printHeader()
    self._printDetails()

def _printHeader(self):
    self.printBanner()

def _printDetails(self):
    print("name:", self.name)
    print("amount:", self.getOutstanding())
```

**Changes Made:**

* **Extract Method:** The method `printOwing` has been refactored to use the Extract Method refactoring technique. This has resulted in the creation of two new private methods, `_printHeader` and `_printDetails`.
* **Separation of Concerns:** The refactored code now follows the Separation of Concerns principle by dividing the responsibility of printing the invoice into two distinct methods: `_printHeader` prints the header information, while `_printDetails` prints the invoice details.
* **Modularity:** The use of private methods has improved the modularity of the code, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
* **Code Duplication Reduction:** The common banner printing logic has been moved to the `_printHeader` method, eliminating code duplication and improving the readability of the `printOwing` method.

**Benefits:**

The refactored code exhibits the following improvements:

* **Enhanced Readability:** The clear separation of responsibilities between the `_printHeader` and `_printDetails` methods makes the code easier to understand and follow.
* **Improved Modularity:** The use of private methods has introduced a level of modularity that facilitates future modifications and extensibility.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** By moving the common banner printing logic into a private method, the refactored code avoids unnecessary duplication and improves maintainability.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The refactoring adheres to the principles of object-oriented design and software development best practices, ensuring maintainability, flexibility, and code reusability.
