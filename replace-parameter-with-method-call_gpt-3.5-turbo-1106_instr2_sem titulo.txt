Explanation of changes:
- Created a class called PriceCalculator to encapsulate all the price calculation related logic and methods.
- Moved the logic for calculating the base price into a separate method called calculateBasePrice() to improve modularity and maintainability.
- Similarly, moved the logic for getting seasonal discount and fees into separate methods getSeasonalDiscount() and getFees() respectively.
- Created a method called discountedPrice() to encapsulate the logic for calculating the final discounted price based on the base price, seasonal discount, and fees.
- Moved the main logic for calculating the final price into a method called calculateFinalPrice(), which orchestrates the calculation process by calling the other methods and returning the final price.
- This refactoring improves readability, modularity, and maintainability by separating the different aspects of price calculation into separate methods and encapsulating them within a class. It also reduces code duplication and simplifies the logic, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.
