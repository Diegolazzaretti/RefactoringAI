Refactored Code:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class Report:
    # ...
    # Introducing the foreign method into this class
    def _get_next_day(self, date):
        return date + timedelta(days=1)
        
    def sendReport(self):
        nextDay = self._get_next_day(self.previousEnd)
        # ...

```

Here the date manipulation code to get the next day was refactored out of the `sendReport` method into a separate helper function `_get_next_day` within the same `Report` class following the 'introduce foreign method' refactoring technique.

This was done for several reasons:

1. **Enhanced Readability**: The task of finding the next day given a date is encapsulated in a dedicated function with an explicit name, making the `sendReport` function easier to understand.

2. **Reduced Code Duplication**: If the process of finding the next day were required elsewhere in the class, we have a dedicated function now and can simply call `_get_next_day` method instead of duplicating the logic every time.

3. **Improved Modularity**: The `_get_next_day` method can be considered a standalone 'module' that performs a specific, well-defined task. This segmentation of responsibilities follows the Single Responsibility Principle (a principle of SOLID), making the code more maintainable.

4. **Enhanced Testability**: With this refactoring, it's now easier to test the functionality of getting the next day, since it's in its own method.

It’s important to note that i used an underscore prefix to denote that the method is intended to be private. This is a common Python convention.

In addition, I used the Python datetime module rather than manually constructing Date. This is more reliable and readable. It's generally a better practice to use built-in language features for common tasks like date manipulation, rather than handling it manually.
