The refactored code is presented below:

class PersonFinder:
    def __init__(self, people):
        self.people = people

    def find_person(self, name):
        if name in self.people:
            return name
        return ""

# Example usage
people = ["Don", "John", "Kent"]
finder = PersonFinder(people)
print(finder.find_person("Don"))
print(finder.find_person("John"))
print(finder.find_person("Kent"))
print(finder.find_person("Mike"))

The refactored code creates a PersonFinder class with a method find_person that takes a name and searches for it in the list of people. The code is more modular and maintainable, as the search logic is encapsulated in a separate class. It adheres to the single responsibility principle and makes the code more organized.

The refactored code also uses the in operator to check if the name is in the list of people, avoiding the need for a loop and simplifying the logic. This reduces code duplication and makes the code more readable and concise.

Additionally, the example usage demonstrates how the PersonFinder class can be used to find different people in the list, contributing to the overall readability and understanding of the code.
