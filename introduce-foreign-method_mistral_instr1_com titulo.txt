mistral - Instrução 1 com titulo:


Here is a possible refactored version of the code, introducing a more modular and readable approach:
```scss
from datetime import timedelta
from .date_utilities import Date

class Report:
    def __init__(self, previousEnd):
        self.previousEnd = previousEnd

    def sendReport(self):
        nextDay = self._getNextDay()
        # ...
```
In this refactored version, we have introduced a separate module for date utilities, which contains the `Date` class and its methods to handle date calculations. The `Report` class now imports this module, using the dot notation to access its methods. We have also extracted the date calculation logic into a private method `_getNextDay()`, making it more modular and easier to understand.
