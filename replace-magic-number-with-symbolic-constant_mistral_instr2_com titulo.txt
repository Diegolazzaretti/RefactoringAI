mistral - Instrução 2 com titulo:

```python
# Define a constant for the acceleration due to gravity
GRAVITY_ACCELERATION = 9.81

# Define a function to calculate potential energy based on the given mass and height
def potentialEnergy(mass, height):
    """Calculate the potential energy of an object at the given height."""
    return mass * GRAVITY_ACCELERATION * height
```
