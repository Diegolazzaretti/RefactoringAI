class PizzaDelivery:
    def __init__(self, numberOfLateDeliveries):
        self.numberOfLateDeliveries = numberOfLateDeliveries
        
    def getRating(self):
        return 2 if self.isLateDelivery() else 1
    
    def isLateDelivery(self):
        return self.numberOfLateDeliveries > 5
Refactored the code to use a constructor to initialize the `numberOfLateDeliveries` attribute within the `PizzaDelivery` class. This enhances readability and modularity by encapsulating the state of the object. The `moreThanFiveLateDeliveries` method is renamed to `isLateDelivery` to better convey its purpose and semantics. This improves code readability and maintainability.
