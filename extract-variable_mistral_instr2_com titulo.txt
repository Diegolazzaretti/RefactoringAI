mistral - Instrução 2 com titulo:


The code provided is a simple if-else statement that checks for certain conditions to be true before executing a block of code. However, it is not very readable or modular as it duplicates several conditions that check for specific strings in the `self.platform` and `self.browser` variables.

To refactor this code, we can create two separate functions that handle each condition and then call these functions within the main function to improve its readability and modularity. We can also extract the common part of the conditions that check for specific strings in the `self.platform` and `self.browser` variables into a separate variable or function, depending on the requirements.

Here is one possible refactored version of the code:
```scss
def shouldRenderBanner(self):
    if self.platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") > -1 and \
       self.browser.toUpperCase().indexOf("IE") > -1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def renderBanner(self):
    if shouldRenderBanner(self) and self.wasInitialized() and self.resize > 0:
        # do something
```
In this version, we have extracted the common part of the conditions that check for specific strings in the `self.platform` and `self.browser` variables into a separate function called `shouldRenderBanner`. We then call this function within the main function to determine if the banner should be rendered.

We have also separated the common condition that checks if the platform is MAC and IE into a separate function called `shouldRenderBanner`. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain as we can now make changes to one of these functions without affecting the other.

Overall, this refactored version of the code adheres to best practices by promoting separation of concerns, reducing code duplication, and improving overall organization. It also provides a clearer and more modular structure that makes it easier to understand and modify in the future.
