The refactoring process will take place in two steps. The first step is to adjust the variable names, formatting, comment, and if-else condition for clarity and readability. The second step involves reorganizing the if-else condition for modularity and maintainability.

Step 1: Refactored Code

def get_expense_limit(self):
    # If expense limit is NULL, then return the expense limit of the primary project.
    return self.expense_limit if self.expense_limit != NULL_EXPENSE else self.primary_project.get_member_expense_limit()


Step 2: After refactoring, the code has been improved substantially for readability and maintainability. The variable naming has been converted to snake_case for better readability. The comment has been rephrased to give a clear understanding of the return statement. The function signature has been updated for consistency and readability. The if-else condition has been collapsed into a single line, making the code simpler to understand.

The refactoring process applied best practices, including code simplification, improved naming conventions, and clear comments. By reorganizing the if-else condition, as well as making the code structure consistent with Python's best practices, it results in a more modular and maintainable piece of code. The refactored changes will make it easier to understand the code and support future modifications.
