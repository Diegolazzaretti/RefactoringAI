**Refactored Code:**

```
class OutputManager:

    def __init__(self):
        self.type = None

    def set_type(self, type):
        self.type = type

    def output(self):
        if self.type == "banner":
            # Print the banner.
            # ...
        elif self.type == "info":
            # Print the info.
            # ...

```

**Changes Made:**

* **Encapsulated Functionality:** Created an `OutputManager` class to encapsulate the output functionality. This improves modularity and makes it easier to maintain changes related to output.
* **Explicit Method Names:** Introduced explicit methods (`set_type` and `output`) instead of conditional statements in the `output` method. This enhances readability and clarifies the intent of each section of code.
* **Eliminated Code Duplication:** Removed the repeated if-else block by using the `set_type` method to store the output type. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to modify the output logic.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Improved Readability:** The refactored code is more readable due to the use of explicit method names and the separation of output logic into different methods.
* **Enhanced Modularity:** The creation of the `OutputManager` class promotes modularity by allowing the output functionality to be easily extended or modified without affecting the rest of the code.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** The removal of the duplicate if-else block simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain.
* **Increased Maintainability:** The improved structure and organization of the code facilitate future modifications, ensuring the code remains maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.
