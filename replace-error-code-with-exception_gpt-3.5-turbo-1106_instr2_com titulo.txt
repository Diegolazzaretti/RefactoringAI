class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount
        return 0

# Refactored code makes use of a class to encapsulate the account functionalities, promoting better organization and reusability of the code. 
# It uses the __init__ method as a constructor to set the initial balance and raises a ValueError if the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance.
# The refactored code also removes the need for error codes by using exceptions to handle the insufficient funds scenario, improving the overall readability and maintainability of the code.
