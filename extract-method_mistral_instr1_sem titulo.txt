```python
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, name, amount):
        self.name = name
        self.amount = amount
    
    # Print the invoice banner
    def printBanner(self):
        print("Invoice Banner")
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Amount: {self.amount:.2f}")
        
    # Get and print the outstanding amount owed
    def printOwing(self):
        self.printBanner()
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Amount:", self.getOutstanding())
```
The refactored code above separates the invoice banner printing logic into its own method `printBanner`. The `printOwing` method now calls this method to print the banner, which improves modularity and readability by making it clear that the banner is a separate concern from the details of the outstanding amount. Additionally, the `amount` attribute is formatted with two decimal places using f-strings for better readability.
