```python
# Use builder pattern to create a class with properties to define the object

class Order:
    def __init__(self, quantity, itemPrice):
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.itemPrice = itemPrice

        # encapsulate the logic of calculating price with a method
    def calculate_base_price(self):
        return self.quantity * self.itemPrice

    def calculate_total(self):
        if self.calculate_base_price() > 1000:
            return self.calculate_base_price() * 0.95
        else:
            return self.calculate_base_price() * 0.98

# Usage of the class 
order = Order(quantity, itemPrice)
total = order.calculate_total()
print(total)
```

In the refactored code, a class `Order` is created to encapsulate the order-related functionalities. With the use of the builder pattern, this class now represents an order with properties and methods. The `calculateTotal` function has been expanded into the `Order` class, including methods to calculate the base price and to determine the total price based on the base price. By creating a specific class for order, the code is more modular, easier to read, and maintainable. This approach follows best practices for object-oriented design and improves the organization and readability of the code. Additionally, the code duplication has been reduced by encapsulating methods to calculate the base price and the total price within the `Order` class.
