# One way to refactor the given code is to make it more modular and readable by using a dictionary to store the values of each column, and then accessing those values when needed. Here's one possible refactored version:

columns = {"Team": None, "Score": None}
row = {key: value for key, value in columns.items()}
row["Team"] = "Liverpool"
row["Score"] = "15"
