**Refactored Code:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DiscountPolicy(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def is_applicable(self, order) -> bool:
        pass

class BasePriceDiscountPolicy(DiscountPolicy):

    def __init__(self, minimum_base_price):
        self.minimum_base_price = minimum_base_price

    def is_applicable(self, order) -> bool:
        base_price = order.base_price()
        return base_price > self.minimum_base_price

def apply_discounts(order):
    discount_policies = [
        BasePriceDiscountPolicy(minimum_base_price=1000),
    ]

    for policy in discount_policies:
        if policy.is_applicable(order):
            return True

    return False
```

**Changes Made:**

* **Introduced Abstraction:** Created an abstract base class `DiscountPolicy` to define the contract for discount policies.
* **Modularity with Strategy Pattern:** Implemented a specific discount policy, `BasePriceDiscountPolicy`, which checks if the order's base price exceeds a threshold.
* **Centralized Discount Policies:** Moved the definition of discount policies to a separate function, `apply_discounts`, for centralized management.
* **Simplified Logic:** Refactored the discount logic into smaller, reusable methods that can be easily modified.
* **Encapsulation:** Encapsulated the logic for determining if a discount is applicable within the `DiscountPolicy` class.

**Benefits of the Refactoring:**

* **Improved Readability:** The refactored code is more organized and easier to understand.
* **Modularity:** Discount policies can be added or removed without affecting the core logic.
* **Maintainability:** The centralized management of discount policies simplifies future modifications.
* **Extensibility:** The Strategy pattern allows for easy addition of new discount policies in the future.
