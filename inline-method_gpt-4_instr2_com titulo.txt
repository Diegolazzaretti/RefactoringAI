gpt-4 - Instrução 2 com titulo:

Here is the refactored code:

```python
class PizzaDelivery:
    # ...
    RATING_LOW = 1
    RATING_HIGH = 2
    LATE_DELIVERY_THRESHOLD = 5

    def get_rating(self):
        return self.RATING_HIGH if self.late_deliveries_exceed_threshold() else self.RATING_LOW
  
    def late_deliveries_exceed_threshold(self):
        return self.number_of_late_deliveries > self.LATE_DELIVERY_THRESHOLD
```

Changes Made:
1. Change camelCase convention to snake_case as per PEP-8 guidelines. Which improves readability and maintainability.
2. Introduced constants (`RATING_LOW`, `RATING_HIGH`, `LATE_DELIVERY_THRESHOLD`) instead of hard-coded numbers, to make the code more self-explanatory and maintainable. Now, if the rating system or the late delivery threshold needs to be changed, we only need to modify the constants.
3. Renamed the method `moreThanFiveLateDeliveries` to `late_deliveries_exceed_threshold()` to make what it does more explicit and make it easier to change the threshold without having the method name become misleading.

The above changes significantly improve the readability, modularity, maintainability of the code, and reduce the likelihood of future code bugs.
