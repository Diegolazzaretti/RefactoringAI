In the refactored code, a class `Output` is defined with methods for printing banner and info. The code uses the concept of encapsulation by using classes and methods to logically group and separate different components of the code. This serves to increase modularity and maintainability, as it helps to organize and structure the code. It also simplifies logic as well as reduces code duplication by facilitating reuse of the methods. It also makes use of appropriate naming conventions and removing conditional checks which improve the readability of the code. The functionality of the code is preserved to maintain its functional integrity.
