gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 - Instrução 2 com titulo:

class Printer:
    
    def display_banner(self):
        # Display the banner.
        # ...

    def display_info(self):
        # Display the info.
        # ...

# Example usage
printer = Printer()
printer.display_banner() # prints the banner
printer.display_info() # prints the info

In the refactored code, a class named Printer is created to represent the functionality of outputting different types of text. The output method with the name parameter has been replaced by two explicit methods: display_banner and display_info. This change enhances maintainability and organization and adheres to the best practices of software development.

By implementing the "replace-parameter-with-explicit-methods refactoring pattern, we avoid conditional logic in the output method and provide separate methods for each type of operation, resulting in a clearer design that is easier to understand and more modular to change over time.
