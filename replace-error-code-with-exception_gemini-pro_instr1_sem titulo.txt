Sure, here is the refactored code with improved readability, modularity, and maintainability:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            return -1  # Insufficient funds

        self.balance -= amount
        return 0  # Withdrawal successful

```

**Enhancements:**

* **Modular approach:** The `withdraw` method is now a standalone function within the `BankAccount` class. This improves modularity and makes it easier to maintain and reuse the code.
* **Descriptive variable names:** The `balance` variable is now named more descriptively, indicating its purpose.
* **Error handling:** The `withdraw` method now returns a negative value (-1) if the withdrawal amount exceeds the account balance, indicating an error. This provides better error handling and consistency.
* **Clear and concise:** The code is now more concise and easier to understand.

**Usage:**

To use the refactored code, you can create a `BankAccount` object and call the `withdraw` method like this:

```python
account = BankAccount(1000)
result = account.withdraw(500)

if result == -1:
    print("Insufficient funds")
else:
    print("Withdrawal successful")
```

This refactored code is more readable, maintainable, and reusable, making it a better solution for managing bank account transactions in your application.
