gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 - Instrução 2 com titulo:

class Soldier:
    def __init__(self, health, damage, weapon_status):
        self.health = health
        self.damage = damage
        self.weapon_status = weapon_status

    def get_damage(self):
        # ...

    def attack(self):
        # ...

# Changes made:
#1. Added an __init__ method to initialize the attributes of the Soldier class.
#2. Changed the attribute names to adhere to snake_case naming convention.
#3. Renamed the getDamage method to get_damage to adhere to snake_case naming convention.
#4. Minor improvements in the comments for clarity.
