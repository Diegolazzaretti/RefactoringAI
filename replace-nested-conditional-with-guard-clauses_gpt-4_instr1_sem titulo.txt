Here's how you could refactor the code:

```python
def get_pay_amount(self):
    if self.is_dead:
        return self.dead_amount()
    elif self.is_separated:
        return self.separated_amount()
    elif self.is_retired:
        return self.retired_amount()
    else:
        return self.normal_pay_amount()
```

This refactor not only makes the code easier to read, but it also improves its modularity and maintainability. The function calls have been changed to method calls on self, assuming that this code is within a class which has relevant methods. 

The variables have been renamed following Python's naming conventions (PEP 8) - constants and variable names should be in snake_case - lower case with underscores aiding readability. Furthermore this also incorporates the exit early principle - return as soon as you know the answer, thus avoiding deep nesting.

Lastly, the if/else chain is converted to if/elif/else which makes it clear that this is a single, disjoint decision making process that always renders just one outcome. 

This also provides a single exit point (simplified control flow) and avoids temporary variable, thereby reducing memory footprint and potential source of bugs.
