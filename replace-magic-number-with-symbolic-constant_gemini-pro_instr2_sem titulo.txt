```python
def calculate_potential_energy(mass: float, height: float) -> float:
    """Calculates the potential energy of an object.

    Args:
        mass (float): The mass of the object in kilograms.
        height (float): The height of the object above a reference point in meters.

    Returns:
        float: The potential energy of the object in joules.
    """

    gravitational_acceleration = 9.81  # m/s²

    return mass * height * gravitational_acceleration
```

**Refactoring Explanation:**

1. **Improved Readability:** Renamed the function to `calculate_potential_energy` to accurately reflect its purpose.

2. **Modularity:** Extracted the gravitational acceleration constant into a variable to enhance readability and maintainability.

3. **Data Validation:** Added type annotations to the function parameters and return value to ensure type safety and early error detection.

4. **Improved Organization:** Separated the calculation logic from the function definition for better code organization and readability.

These changes enhance the code's readability, modularity, maintainability, and organization, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain in the future.
