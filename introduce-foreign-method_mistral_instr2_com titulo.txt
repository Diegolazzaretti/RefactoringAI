The code provided is a simple Python class that has a method called `sendReport` which calculates the next day of a given date using the built-in `Date` class and sends a report. The following are the changes made to refactor the code:

1. **Extracting the calculation logic into a separate method:** The calculation of the next day is a small and independent block of functionality that can be extracted into a separate method called `getNextDay` to reduce code duplication and improve modularity. This also makes the code more readable as it separates concerns.
```python
class Report:
    # ...
    def sendReport(self):
        next_day = self.getNextDay()
        # ...
```
2. **Extracting the date utility class into a separate module:** The `Date` class is used only in this method, so it can be extracted into a separate module called `dateutils`. This makes the code more maintainable as any changes made to the `Date` class will only affect one place in the code and not other places where it might be used.
```python
from dateutils import Date
class Report:
    # ...
    def sendReport(self):
        next_day = self.getNextDay()
        # ...
```
3. **Renaming the method to better reflect its functionality:** The method `sendReport` does not provide much information about what it is doing, so it can be renamed to something more descriptive like `generateNextReport`. This makes the code more readable and self-explanatory.
```python
from dateutils import Date
class Report:
    # ...
    def generateNextReport(self):
        next_day = self.getNextDay()
        # ...
```

The refactored code is now more modular, maintainable, and readable. It separates concerns by extracting independent blocks of functionality into separate methods or modules. This makes it easier to modify the code in the future while ensuring that the functional integrity is maintained.
