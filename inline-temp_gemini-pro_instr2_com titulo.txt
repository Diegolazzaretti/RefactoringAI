**Refactored Code:**

```python
def hasDiscount(order):
    return order.basePrice() > 1000
```

**Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Inline Temporary Variable:** The variable `basePrice` is only used once, so it can be eliminated by inlining it. This reduces clutter and improves readability.

2. **Simplified Logic:** The if-else statement is unnecessary since the calculation directly returns the desired result.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Enhanced Readability:** The code is now more concise and easier to understand.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** The temporary variable is no longer defined twice.
* **Simplified Logic:** The if-else statement is eliminated, making the code more straightforward.
* **Improved Maintainability:** The refactored code is easier to modify in the future, as there are fewer lines of code to change.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The refactored code follows the "Inline Temporary Variable" refactoring technique, which is a common practice in software development to enhance code quality.
