**Refactored Code:**

```python
def get_billing_plan(customer):
    """Returns the billing plan for the specified customer.

    Args:
        customer: The customer object.

    Returns:
        The billing plan for the customer.
    """

    if customer is None:
        return _get_basic_plan()
    else:
        return customer.get_plan()


def _get_basic_plan():
    """Returns the basic billing plan."""

    return BillingPlan.basic()
```

**Enhancements:**

* **Readability:** The code is now more readable due to the use of descriptive function names and comments.
* **Modularity:** The code is now more modularized by extracting the logic for getting the basic plan into a separate function.
* **Maintainability:** The code is now more maintainable by providing a clear separation of concerns between the main function and the helper function.
