Introduce Foreign Method Refactored Code:

class Report:

    def sendReport(self):
        nextDay = self.calculateNextDay()
        # ...

    def calculateNextDay(self):
        nextDay = Date(self.previousEnd.getYear(),
                       self.previousEnd.getMonth(), self.previousEnd.getDate() + 1)
        return nextDay


# The original code is refactored by introducing a new method named calculateNextDay().
# The method is responsible for the logic to calculate the next day from the current date.
# This improves the readability, modularity, and maintainability of the code.
# The introduce foreign method design pattern is applied to create a new method that encapsulates the foreign logic.
# This helps in reducing code duplication, simplifying the overall logic, and improving the organization of functionality.
# It also adheres to the best practices of software development, making the code more maintainable and facilitating future modifications while maintaining functional integrity.
