One way to refactor this code is by introducing a DisabilityAmount class that encapsulates the logic for calculating the disability amount. Here's an example of how the refactored code could look like:
```python
class DisabilityAmount:
    def __init__(self, seniority: int, months_disabled: int, is_part_time: bool):
        self.seniority = seniority
        self.months_disabled = months_disabled
        self.is_part_time = is_part_time
    
    def calculate_amount(self) -> float:
        if self.seniority < 2:
            return 0
        elif self.months_disabled > 12:
            return 0
        elif self.is_part_time:
            return 0
        else:
            # Compute the disability amount using some formula or algorithm.
            # ...
            return some_result
```
In this refactored code, we have introduced a new class called DisabilityAmount that takes in three parameters - seniority, months\_disabled, and is\_part\_time - as its constructor. The calculate\_amount method of the class implements the logic for calculating the disability amount based on these parameters.

We have also removed the conditional statements and moved them into the appropriate methods of the DisabilityAmount class. This makes the code more modular, readable, and maintainable.

The use of classes and encapsulation helps to reduce code duplication and simplify the logic of the program. It also makes it easier to modify and extend the code in the future without affecting other parts of the program.
