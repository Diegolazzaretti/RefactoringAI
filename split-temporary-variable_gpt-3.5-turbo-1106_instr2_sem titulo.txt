```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, height, width):
        self.height = height
        self.width = width

    def calculate_perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.height + self.width)

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.height * self.width

rectangle1 = Rectangle(5, 8)
print(rectangle1.calculate_perimeter())
print(rectangle1.calculate_area())
```

Changes made:
1. Created a `Rectangle` class to encapsulate the properties and operations related to a rectangle.
2. Defined methods `calculate_perimeter` and `calculate_area` to calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle, respectively.
3. Removed the need for temporary variables and repetitive print statements. This improves readability and reduces code duplication.
4. Made use of object-oriented programming principles to enhance modularity and maintainability.
5. The refactored code is structured, organized, and adheres to best practices making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.
