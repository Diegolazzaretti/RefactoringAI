Here's the refactored code:

```python
def found_person(people):
    target_people = ['Don', 'John', 'Kent']
    
    for person in people:
        if person in target_people:
            return person
            
    return ""
```

Changes made:
1. Renamed the `foundPerson` function and `people` argument to `found_person` and `people` respectively, following Python's naming convention that favors lowercase letters and underscores.
2. A list `target_people` was created to hold all the target strings. By doing this, the hard-coded if statements have been eliminated, making the code easier to read and maintain. Further, it allows easy addition or removal of target persons.
3. Changed the for loop so that it directly iterates over elements in `people`, instead of indices. This is more pythonic and makes code shorter and easier to read.
