After refactoring the code, we got:

```python
def get_pay_amount(self):
    amount_calculators = {
        'isDead': dead_amount,
        'isSeparated': separated_amount,
        'isRetired': retired_amount
    }

    for condition, calculator in amount_calculators.items():
        if getattr(self, condition):
            return calculator()

    return normal_pay_amount()
```

Explaination:

1. **Rename function to follow Python naming convention**: Python's naming convention suggests lowercase with words separated by underscores for the function names. We've changed `getPayAmount` to `get_pay_amount` to comply with this.

2. **Switch from nested if-else statements to dictionary dispatch**: The given code uses several nested if-else clauses to determine the method to calculate payment amount. We switch to a dictionary-based dispatching approach. This makes the code more readable and easily scalable. For a new condition, we just need to add it to the `amount_calculators` dictionary without disturbing rest of the code.

3. **Use getattr function**: `getattr` function provides dynamic access to an object's attributes. Instead of hardcoding attribute access, `getattr` makes the access dynamic, improving code modularity.

4. **Early return**: Instead of assigning a result and then returning it at the end of the function, we return the result immediately once it's known. Reduces the need for a `result` variable, simplifying the function.

The refactored code follows best practices, is highly modular, scalable, and maintainable. It provides an effective way for future enhancements or modifications. The functional integrity is also maintained as the overall logic has been kept intact while refactoring.
