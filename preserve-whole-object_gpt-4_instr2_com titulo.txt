Refactored Code:
```
withinPlan = plan.withinRange(daysTempRange.getRange())
```

Changes Made:
The original code first retrieves the high and low values from 'daysTempRange', and then passes these as separate arguments to the 'withinRange' method. This is an example of not preserving the whole object, where the object in question is the 'range' of 'daysTempRange'. 

In the refactored code, instead of extracting individual values from 'daysTempRange', the whole 'range' object itself is passed to 'withinRange'. This change increases readability by reducing the number of lines and simplifying the logic, as there is no need to mention 'low' and 'high' separately. 

Moreover, in terms of modularity and maintainability, this approach is advantageous because if the 'range' object is changed in the future to have more than just 'low' and 'high' values (for example, 'average', 'median' etc.), we would not need to change the 'withinRange' invocation - it would just continue to work with the new 'range' object. This is an example of the 'preserve whole object' design pattern, where instead of decomposing the object and passing its individual parts to a method, the entire object is passed.

This refactoring also encourages stronger encapsulation because the details of how to extract the 'high' and 'low' from a 'range' object would now be enclosed within the 'withinRange' method, instead of being spread throughout the code.

Note: This refactoring assumes that the 'withinRange' method and 'getRange' method have been appropriately updated to handle the 'range' object as their argument and return value respectively.

If the 'getRange' function does not exist or similar function does not exist, it may need to be implemented like:

```python
class DaysTempRange:
  def getRange(self):
    return (self.low, self.high)
```

If the 'withinRange' method does not accept an object parameter, you may need to modify that method as well:

```python
class Plan:
  def withinRange(self, range):
    # Extract the values from range within the function
    low, high = range
```
