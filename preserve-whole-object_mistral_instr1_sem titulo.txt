To enhance the readability, modularity and maintainability of the given code, we can make use of variables to store the low and high temperatures, and then check if the withinPlan variable is within the range using a conditional statement. Here's one way to refactor the code:
```
low = daysTempRange.getLow()
high = daysTempRange.getHigh()

# Create a variable to store whether the temperature falls within the plan
withinPlan = False

if low <= plan.lowerBound and high >= plan.upperBound:
    # If it does, set the variable to True
    withinPlan = True
else:
    # If not, set the variable to False
    withinPlan = False
``` 
This refactored code is more modular and maintainable as we have separated the logic of checking if the temperature falls within the plan from the original code. The variable `withinPlan` can be used in other parts of the program, making it easier to understand and modify. Additionally, this code is more readable as it uses descriptive variable names and clear conditional statements.
