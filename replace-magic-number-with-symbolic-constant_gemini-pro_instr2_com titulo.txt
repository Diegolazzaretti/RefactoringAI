```python
import math

def potential_energy(mass: float, height: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the potential energy of an object given its mass and height.

    Args:
        mass (float): Mass of the object in kilograms.
        height (float): Height of the object above a reference point in meters.

    Returns:
        float: Potential energy in Joules.
    """

    # Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)
    GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION = 9.81

    return mass * height * GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION
```

**Refactoring Summary:**

* **Refactored the code to use a symbolic constant for the gravitational acceleration.** This eliminates the "magic number" 9.81 and makes the code more readable and maintainable.
* **Modularized the calculation by creating a separate function.** This makes it easier to reuse the potential energy calculation in other parts of the codebase.
* **Added type annotations to the function arguments and return value.** This helps improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.
* **Updated the function docstring to better describe its purpose and inputs/outputs.** This provides more information to the user and improves the code's documentation.
