**Refactored Code:**

```
class RenderService:

    def __init__(self, platform, browser, resize):
        self.platform = platform
        self.browser = browser
        self.resize = resize

    def canRender(self):
        return (self.platform.upper().find("MAC") > -1 and
                self.browser.upper().find("IE") > -1 and
                self.resize > 0)

    def render(self):
        if self.canRender():
            # do something


# Usage:
service = RenderService("Mac", "IE", 10)
if service.canRender():
    service.render()
```

**Changes Made:**

* **Encapsulation:** The rendering logic is encapsulated within the `RenderService` class, separating it from the view. This improves modularity and makes it easier to modify the rendering behavior in the future.
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The `RenderService` class has a single responsibility: rendering banners. This makes the code easier to reason about and maintain.
* **Method Extraction:** The `canRender` method extracts the rendering logic into a separate method, which improves the readability of the `render` method.
* **Conditional Invocation:** The rendering logic is now invoked conditionally based on the output of the `canRender` method. This avoids unnecessary code execution and makes the code more concise.
* **Object-Oriented Approach:** The use of the `RenderService` class promotes an object-oriented approach, where the rendering logic is encapsulated in an object instance. This facilitates easier maintenance and modification.

**Benefits of these Changes:**

* **Improved Readability:** The refactored code is easier to read and understand due to the clear separation of concerns and the use of descriptive method names.
* **Enhanced Modularity:** The modular design allows for easy modification of the rendering logic without affecting other parts of the code.
* **Increased Maintainability:** The object-oriented approach and the SRP make it easier to maintain the code and add new features in the future.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** The extraction of the `canRender` method eliminates code duplication and improves the overall code organization.
