Refactored code:

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, primary_base_price=0, secondary_base_price=0, tertiary_base_price=0):
        self.primary_base_price = primary_base_price
        self.secondary_base_price = secondary_base_price
        self.tertiary_base_price = tertiary_base_price
        
    def calculate_price(self):
        return self.calculate_primary() + self.calculate_secondary() + self.calculate_tertiary()
    
    def calculate_primary(self):
        # Perform long computation for primary base price.
        return primaryBasePrice * 100
        
    def calculate_secondary(self):
        # Perform long computation for secondary base price.
        return secondaryBasePrice * 50
        
    def calculate_tertiary(self):
        # Perform long computation for tertiary base price.
        return tertiaryBasePrice * 25
```

Changes made to the code:

1. Extracted calculation logic into separate methods (calculate\_primary(), calculate\_secondary(), and calculate\_tertiary()) to avoid duplication of the long computations.
2. Created an instance variable `__init__(primary_base_price, secondary_base_price, tertiary_base_price)` to store the base prices. 
3. Modified the method `price()` to delegate the computation logic to a new method `calculate_price()`. This method calls the instance variables and their respective methods to compute the total price.
4. Added appropriate comments to improve readability.

These changes contribute to the improvements by:

1. Reducing code duplication and simplifying the logic, making it more maintainable.
2. Introducing modularity through the separation of concerns into different methods and variables. 
3. Enhancing overall organization by following best practices of software development such as naming conventions (using descriptive names for instance variables and methods). 
4. Facilitating future modifications while maintaining functional integrity, as changes can now be made to individual methods or base prices without affecting other parts of the code.
