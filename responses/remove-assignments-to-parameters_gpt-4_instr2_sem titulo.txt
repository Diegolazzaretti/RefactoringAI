gpt-4 - Instrução 2 sem titulo:

The given code snippet applies a discount to an `inputVal` based on the value of `quantity`. However, it only demonstrates one condition and doesn't provide a complete overview of all scenarios, and there is no return statement visible. So, my refactor will be based on some assumptions.

Here's the refactored code:

```python
class DiscountCalculator:

    DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 50
    DISCOUNT_VALUE = 2

    def __init__(self, input_val, quantity):
        self.input_val = input_val
        self.quantity = quantity

    def calculate_discount(self):
        if self.quantity > self.DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD:
            self.input_val -= self.DISCOUNT_VALUE
        return self.input_val

# Usage:
calculator = DiscountCalculator(100, 55)
discounted_value = calculator.calculate_discount()
```

Explanation of changes:

1. Encapsulation: Wrapped the code into a class `DiscountCalculator`, making all related functionality and data stored together. The class can be instantiated repeatedly for different input values and quantities, promoting reusability and modularity.

2. Use of Constants: Extracted the discount threshold and value as class level constants. This would make it easier to update these values in the future, enhancing maintainability.

3. Self-documenting code: `calculate_discount` is more descriptive than `discount`. Function names should ideally reflect the operation they are performing. Also, used clear and full variable names, which help in understanding the code better.

4. Return value: The refactored function now returns the updated input value after applying discounts.

Remember, this refactoring is based on the assumption that the given discount rule is the only one, and the returned value from the function should be the discounted `inputVal`. For more complex discount rules, a different design pattern like Strategy or Factory may be more appropriate.
