The given code is nested and difficult to read due to multiple conditional statements. We can refactor it using the guard clauses pattern to make it more modular and maintainable. The guard clauses pattern is a design pattern that uses boolean expressions at the beginning of a function or method to evaluate whether certain conditions are met, and if so, to proceed with the execution of the function/method; otherwise, to return an error or take another action.

Here's the refactored code using guard clauses:
```python
def getPayAmount(self):
    if not self.isAlive():  # Check if the employee is still alive
        result = deadAmount()  # Return dead amount if employee is dead
        return result
    
    elif self.isSeparated():  # Check if the employee is separated
        result = separatedAmount()  # Return separated amount if employee is separated
        return result
    
    else:  # Employee is not separated or retired
        result = normalPayAmount()  # Return normal pay amount if employee is neither separated nor retired
        return result
```
In the refactored code, we have replaced the nested conditional statements with guard clauses. We have used a boolean expression to check if the employee is still alive, and if not, returned the dead amount using the `deadAmount()` function. If the employee is not dead, we have checked if they are separated, and if so, returned the separated amount using the `separatedAmount()` function. Otherwise, we have returned the normal pay amount using the `normalPayAmount()` function.

This refactored code adheres to best practices of software development, making it more modular and maintainable. It is easier to read and understand, as well as more flexible for future modifications. The guard clauses pattern helps to reduce code duplication by providing a concise and consistent way to evaluate multiple conditions at the beginning of a function or method.
