Here is the refactored version. The health, damage and weapon status are encapsulated in their own classes to create a more modular design and promote readability and maintainability.

```python
class Health:
    def __init__(self):
        self._health = 0

    def get_health(self):
        return self._health

    def set_health(self, amount):
        self._health = amount


class Weapon:
    def __init__(self):
        self._damage = 0
        self._status = 0

    def get_status(self):
        return self._status

    def set_status(self, status):
        self._status = status

    def get_damage(self):
        return self._damage

    def set_damage(self, damage):
        self._damage = damage


class Soldier:
    def __init__(self):
        self._health = Health()
        self._weapon = Weapon()
        
    def get_damage(self):
        return self._weapon.get_damage()

    def attack(self):
        # Insert code here.
```
This refactoring allows more granular control and modification of the components (Health and Weapon) of a Soldier. It is also easy to understand as the responsibilities of Soldier, Health, and Weapon are clearly separated. This code is also more maintainable as each class can be updated and modified independently.
