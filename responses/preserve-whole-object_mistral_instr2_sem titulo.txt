To enhance the readability and maintainability of this code, we can apply a design pattern called the Template Method Pattern. This pattern allows us to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, and then provide specific implementations for certain steps within that algorithm. In this case, we will create a template method `checkPlanWithinRange` that takes in two parameters (`low` and `high`) and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the plan is within the given range. We will also create an implementation of this method called `CheckDaysTempRangePlan`, which will be responsible for checking if the days temperature plan is within the given range. 

The refactored code would look like this:
```java
public abstract class Plan {
    public abstract boolean withinRange(double low, double high);
}

public class CheckDaysTempRangePlan extends Plan {
    @Override
    public boolean withinRange(double low, double high) {
        // Implementation for checking if days temperature plan is within range goes here
    }
}
```
We have created an abstract `Plan` class that defines the template method `withinRange`. This allows us to define other types of plans that can also implement this method. We have then created a concrete implementation of this method called `CheckDaysTempRangePlan`, which will be responsible for checking if the days temperature plan is within the given range. 

By applying this design pattern, we have reduced code duplication by creating a template method that can be implemented by multiple types of plans. We have also simplified the logic by separating the algorithm for checking if a plan is within a range from the specific implementation of that algorithm for checking if the days temperature plan is within the range. This makes it easier to modify and maintain the code in the future, as we can simply create new implementations of the `Plan` class without having to change the template method.
