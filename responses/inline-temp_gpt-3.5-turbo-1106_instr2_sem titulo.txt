class DiscountChecker:
    @staticmethod
    def has_discount(order):
        base_price = order.base_price()
        return base_price > 1000

class Order:
    def __init__(self, base_price):
        self.base_price = base_price

    def base_price(self):
        return self.base_price

# Comments:
# I refactored the code by creating a class to handle the discount check logic and separated it from the Order class for better modularity and readability. 
# I also updated the variable and method names to follow the snake_case naming convention, which is a best practice for Python. 
# The DiscountChecker class now provides a single method, `has_discount`, to encapsulate the logic for checking whether an order has a discount based on its base price. 
# Additionally, I added an Order class as an example to demonstrate how the `has_discount` method can be used with the base_price method to get order details.
