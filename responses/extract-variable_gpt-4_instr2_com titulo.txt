Following is the refactored code:

```python
class Banner:

    def _is_mac_platform(self):
        PLATFORM_IDENTIFIER = "MAC"
        return PLATFORM_IDENTIFIER in self.platform.upper()
    
    def _is_ie_browser(self):
        BROWSER_IDENTIFIER = "IE"
        return BROWSER_IDENTIFIER in self.browser.upper()
    
    def can_render(self):
        return self._is_mac_platform() and self._is_ie_browser() and self.was_initialized() and (self.resize > 0)
    
    def render(self):
        if self.can_render():
            # do something
            pass
        else: 
            # do something else
            pass
```

In the refactored code, I made below considerations:

1. Classes: First step of the refactoring process is to encapsulate the code inside a class (Banner). This allows for a more modular approach and helps in maintaining object oriented principles. 

2. Function Naming: Renamed the main function `renderBanner` to `render` since we already know we are inside Banner class, `renderBanner` would be redundant. 

3. Lower-Level Functions: Functions `_is_mac_platform()` and `_is_ie_browser()` have been added to break down the complex if condition from the initial code segment. This helps enhance the modularity and readability of the code, as the logic behind each of the browser type check is now separately located in self-explanatory named functions.

4. Constants: Application of constants (`PLATFORM_IDENTIFIER` and `BROWSER_IDENTIFIER`) to enhance readability and simplifying future changes.

5. Intermediary Function: `can_render` has been added as a higher level function cleaning up the condition from the main `render` method. This enhances the readability and understandability of the condition required for rendering the banner, making the main `render` method simpler.

In general, code is now more modular, maintainable, easier to understand and expand, reinforcing the principles of clean code and single responsibility principle. The functional behavior of the code remains intact while increasing the versatility for future modifications.
