It is always good to break a complex if conditions into separately manageable functions. Here I would split it into its own function named `isWinterSeason`. This will make the code easier to read. Also having the charge calculation separately in a function would make the solution more cleaner.

Here is the refactor code:

```python
def is_winter_season(date):
    return date.before(SUMMER_START) or date.after(SUMMER_END)

def calculate_charge(quantity, rate, service_charge=0):
    return quantity * rate + service_charge

if is_winter_season(date):
    charge = calculate_charge(quantity, winterRate, winterServiceCharge)
else:
    charge = calculate_charge(quantity, summerRate)
``` 

By moving `quantity * rate + service_charge` to a function, we avoid duplication and make our intention clear. Also the new function `calculate_charge` is more flexible because we can specify a different `service_charge`, but have chosen to set a default of 0 for the cases where we don't have a `service_charge`.
