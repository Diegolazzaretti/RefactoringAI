After Refactoring:

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, outstanding_amount):
        self.name = name
        self.outstanding_amount = outstanding_amount

    @staticmethod 
    def print_banner():
        pass # method definition for print_banner

    def print_details(self):
        print(f"name: {self.name}")
        print(f"amount: {self.outstanding_amount}")

    def print_owing(self):
        self.print_banner()
        self.print_details()

Explanation of the changes:

1. Encapsulated the code into a class named `Customer`. This encapsulation provides a single place to maintain all the tasks of a customer's indebtedness, enhancing the organization of the code. In this way, the code adheres better to the principle of Single Responsibility in SOLID principles.

2. Created an instance variables `name` and `outstanding_amount` with the __init__ method of the class. These variables capture and maintain the state of each customer object.

3. Refactored `printBanner` and `printOwing` into separate methods, `print_banner` and `print_details`, within the class. This separation promotes better readability and maintainability since each method now has one specific task. 

4. Renamed methods with Python's naming convention of lower case with underscores. This is preferred over CamelCase for function/variable names in Python.

5. Used f-strings in `print_details` to interpolate variables directly into strings. This makes the code more readable.

6. Handled `print_banner` as a static method because it is likely not altering or dependent on the state of the Customer object. It improves the design by not tightly binding the method to the instance.

The resulting refactored code is modular, more readable, and maintainable, promoting easier future modifications. The functional integrity of the original code is maintained throughout.
