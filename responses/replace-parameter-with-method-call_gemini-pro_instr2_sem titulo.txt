```python
class Sale:
    def __init__(self, quantity, item_price, seasonal_discount, fees):
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.item_price = item_price
        self.seasonal_discount = seasonal_discount
        self.fees = fees

    def calculate_base_price(self):
        return self.quantity * self.item_price

    def calculate_final_price(self):
        base_price = self.calculate_base_price()
        discounted_price = self.apply_seasonal_discount(base_price)
        final_price = self.add_fees(discounted_price)
        return final_price

    def apply_seasonal_discount(self, base_price):
        return base_price * (1 - self.seasonal_discount)

    def add_fees(self, discounted_price):
        return discounted_price + self.fees
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Modularization**: We have separated the calculation of base price, seasonal discount, and final price into separate methods. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

2. **Encapsulation**: We have encapsulated the data and logic related to the sale within a class. This allows us to create multiple sales objects and manipulate them independently.

3. **Design Patterns**: The code uses the **Strategy Pattern** for applying seasonal discounts. By defining a separate `apply_seasonal_discount` method, we can easily change the discount strategy in the future without affecting the rest of the code.

4. **Improved Readability**: The refactored code is more structured and organized, making it easier to read and understand the flow of execution.

5. **Maintanability**: The separation of concerns and encapsulation make the code more maintainable. Changes to one part of the code (e.g., the discount strategy) will not affect the rest of the application.
