mistral - Instrução 1 com titulo:


To enhance readability, modularity, and maintainability, we can refactor the given code as follows:

1. Create a function named `get_plan` that accepts an argument `customer` and returns the billing plan for the customer.
2. Within the `get_plan` function, use an if-else statement to check whether the customer is None. If the customer is None, then return the basic billing plan using the `BillingPlan.basic()` method. Otherwise, call the `getPlan()` method on the customer object and return it.
3. Use the function to get the billing plan for a given customer by passing the customer object as an argument.
```python
from billing_plans import BillingPlan

def get_plan(customer):
    if customer is None:
        plan = BillingPlan.basic()
    else:
        plan = customer.getPlan()
    return plan

# Example usage:
plan = get_plan(my_customer)  # Assuming my_customer is an instance of the Customer class
```
By refactoring the code in this way, we have improved its modularity and readability while maintaining the same functionality. The `get_plan()` function can be easily extended or modified if needed, making it more maintainable over time.
