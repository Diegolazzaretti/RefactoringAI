Here's the refactored Python code:

```python
def is_platform_mac(self):
    return "MAC" in self.platform.upper()

def is_browser_ie(self):
    return "IE" in self.browser.upper()

def render_banner(self):
    if self.is_platform_mac() and self.is_browser_ie() and self.was_initialized() and self.resize > 0:
        # do something
```

In this refactor, we've moved the checks for "Mac" and "IE" into their own methods (`is_platform_mac` and `is_browser_ie`), which makes it easier to decipher what those specific checks are doing. This also allows those functions to be tested separately and reused elsewhere in the code if needed.
 
Additionally, Python has a built-in string method `in` which works well for checking if one string is in another, so we used that instead of `indexOf`. This method returns `True` if it finds a string within a string else `False`, making the code easier to read. 

Also, to keep all functions pythonic, `renderBanner` should be in snake_case, which is to say, `render_banner`.
