```python
class Soldier:
    def __init__(self, health=0, damage=0, weapon_status=0):
        self.health = health
        self.damage = damage
        self.weapon_status = weapon_status

    def get_damage(self):
        # ...

    def attack(self):
        # ...
```

The refactored code has been broken down into smaller, more modular functions to improve readability and maintainability. The `__init__` method initializes the object's attributes with default values. This allows for easier customization of objects when they are created. Additionally, the naming conventions used in the refactored code follow PEP 8 guidelines, which makes the code more consistent and easier to read.
