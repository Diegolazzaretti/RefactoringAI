gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 - Instrução 2 com titulo:

Refactored code:

```
def calculate_total_price(price):
    if isSpecialDeal():
        return apply_special_deal_discount(price)
    else:
        return apply_regular_discount(price)

def apply_special_deal_discount(price):
    return price * 0.95

def apply_regular_discount(price):
    return price * 0.98

def send():
    # send logic here

total = calculate_total_price(price)
send()
```

Changes made:
1. Created separate functions for applying special deal discount and regular discount to improve readability and modularity.
2. Moved the send logic to a separate function to improve organization and reduce code duplication.
3. Created a main function `calculate_total_price` to handle conditionals and return the total price, improving maintainability and code structure.
4. Removed duplicate code for sending the final price, which reduces redundancy and simplifies the logic. 
5. Used descriptive function and variable names to enhance readability and maintainability.
