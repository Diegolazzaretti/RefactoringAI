One approach to refactoring the given code would be to use the Strategy design pattern. This pattern allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This way, we can create classes for the different seasonal rates and service charges and use them based on the date.

Here's the refactored code using the Strategy pattern:

```java
// Define the interface for the charging strategy
public interface ChargingStrategy {
    double calculateCharge(int quantity);
}

// Create a class for the winter charging strategy
public class WinterChargingStrategy implements ChargingStrategy {
    private double winterRate;
    private double winterServiceCharge;

    public WinterChargingStrategy(double winterRate, double winterServiceCharge) {
        this.winterRate = winterRate;
        this.winterServiceCharge = winterServiceCharge;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateCharge(int quantity) {
        return quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge;
    }
}

// Create a class for the summer charging strategy
public class SummerChargingStrategy implements ChargingStrategy {
    private double summerRate;

    public SummerChargingStrategy(double summerRate) {
        this.summerRate = summerRate;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateCharge(int quantity) {
        return quantity * summerRate;
    }
}

// Create a class to calculate the charge based on the date
public class ChargeCalculator {
    private ChargingStrategy summerStrategy;
    private ChargingStrategy winterStrategy;

    public ChargeCalculator(double winterRate, double winterServiceCharge, double summerRate) {
        this.winterStrategy = new WinterChargingStrategy(winterRate, winterServiceCharge);
        this.summerStrategy = new SummerChargingStrategy(summerRate);
    }

    public double calculateCharge(Date date, int quantity) {
        if (date.before(SUMMER_START) || date.after(SUMMER_END)) {
            return winterStrategy.calculateCharge(quantity);
        } else {
            return summerStrategy.calculateCharge(quantity);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, we have created an interface called `ChargingStrategy` to represent the different charging algorithms. We then implemented two concrete strategies: `WinterChargingStrategy` and `SummerChargingStrategy`, each with its own calculation logic for charging. We created a `ChargeCalculator` class to handle the calculation of charges based on the date and quantity. This refactoring enhances readability, modularity, and maintainability by encapsulating the charging logic into separate classes, allowing for easier modification and extension in the future. It also reduces code duplication by applying the Strategy pattern to simplify the charging logic.
