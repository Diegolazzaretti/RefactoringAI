```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        self.balance -= amount
```

In this refactored code:

1. We moved the balance initialization to the constructor (__init__ method) to separate initialization logic from account operations.
2. We replaced the error code (-1) with a meaningful exception (ValueError) to provide better error handling and debugging information.
3. We removed the unnecessary else block since the code after the if block is already executed if the condition is False.
