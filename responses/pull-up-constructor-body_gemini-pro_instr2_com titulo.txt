**Refactored Code:**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, id, grade):
        super().__init__(name, id)
        self.grade = grade

class Manager(Employee):
    pass
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Pull-up Constructor Body:** The constructor body from the `Manager` class is pulled up to the `Employee` class. This reduces code duplication and allows for the reuse of initialization logic in both `Employee` and `Manager`.

* **Super Constructor Call:** In the `Employee` constructor, we call `super().__init__(name, id)` to initialize the inherited attributes from the `Person` class.

* **Modularized Inheritance:** The inheritance hierarchy is simplified by defining `Person` as the base class and `Employee` as an intermediate class inheriting from both `Person` and `Manager`. This modularization allows for clear separation of concerns and future extensibility.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Reduced Code Duplication:** The pull-up constructor body eliminates duplicate initialization code, improving code maintainability and reducing the risk of errors.

* **Simplified Logic:** The use of super constructor call makes the initialization logic concise and straightforward, enhancing code readability.

* **Improved Organization:** Modularizing the inheritance hierarchy clarifies the relationships between classes, fostering better understanding and flexibility for future modifications.

* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The refactored code adheres to the principle of avoiding duplicate code and leveraging inheritance effectively, resulting in a more robust and maintainable design.
