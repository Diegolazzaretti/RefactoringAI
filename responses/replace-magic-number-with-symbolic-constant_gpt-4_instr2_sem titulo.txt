gpt-4 - Instrução 2 sem titulo:

The provided code is actually quite simple and does not present any significant issues that would need refactoring. It already adheres to the basic principles of software development - simplicity, readability, and maintainability.

However, we can still make a few refinements, one of which could be the introduction of named constants, especially if these are values that have a specific meaning and won't change throughout the application:

```python
GRAVITY = 9.81

def potential_energy(mass, height):
    return mass * height * GRAVITY
```

Changes Made:

1. Created a constant GRAVITY and replaced the magic number 9.81 with it. This makes it easier to understand and follow what the code is doing.

2. Renamed `potentialEnergy` to `potential_energy` following the Python's naming conventions. Python follows snake case (_lowercase_with_underscores_) naming conventions for function names.

3. Added a docstring for the function to provide a high-level understanding of the function’s purpose, its arguments, and return type. 

Here's how the final code could look like:

```python
"""Module for calculating physical quantities."""

GRAVITY = 9.81

def potential_energy(mass: float, height: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the potential energy of an object.

    Args:
        mass: mass of the object in kilograms.
        height: height of the object in meters from the ground level.

    Returns:
        The potential energy of the object in joules.
    """
    return mass * height * GRAVITY

```
