The given code is already quite readable and modular. It defines a function to calculate the potential energy, a typical formula in Physics. The code is simple, and it does a single, clear task, and the variable names are clear and intuitive. Therefore, it does not require much refactoring. However, we could add docstrings to enhance the readability further:

```python
def potential_energy(mass: float, height: float) -> float:
    """
    This function calculates the potential energy of an object of a given mass and at a certain height.
    
    Parameters:
    mass (float): The mass of the object in kilograms.
    height (float): The height of the object in m.
    
    Returns:
    float: The potential energy of an object in Joules.
    """
    GRAVITY = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
    return mass * height * GRAVITY
```

This refactoring includes:
- Renaming the function and parameters to follow Python's PEP 8 naming conventions
- Adding a docstring to explain what the function does, its parameters, and return value
- Defining a constant for gravity to increase readability and maintainability
