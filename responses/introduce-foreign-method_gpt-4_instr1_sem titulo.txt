When refactoring your code, consider:

1. Using meaningful names for your variables and methods.
2. Creating smaller, self-documenting, reusable functions.
3. Writing comments to explain what your code does when it's not immediately clear.

The refactored code according to these principles could look as follows:

```python
class Report:
    # ...

    def get_next_day(self, date):
        """
        Returns the next day after the input date.
        """
        return Date(date.getYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate() + 1)

    def send_report(self):
        """
        Sends report with the details of the next day.
        """
        next_day = self.get_next_day(self.previous_end)
        # ...
```
In the refactored code, I:

1. Renamed the method `sendReport` to `send_report` and `nextDay` to `next_day` in order to follow the Pythonic naming convention known as snake_case.
2. Extracted part of the `send_report` code to a new method, `get_next_day`. This improves readability, makes the function reusable, and breaks down the `send_report` method, making it more modular.
3. Added docstrings to methods. This provides clear explanations of what each method does, which can be beneficial for others reading your code. 

However, ensure your project or team does not have specific guidelines on how to refactor or structure your code. Although Python predominantly uses snake_case, some projects or teams may still use camelCase. Additionally, some teams may have different requirements or recommendations for comments and docstrings. Always adhere to your project's or team's coding conventions.
