After the suggested refactoring, the code could look as follows:

```python
def calculate_charge(date, quantity):
    if is_summer(date):
        return summer_charge(quantity)
    else:
        return winter_charge(quantity)

def is_summer(date):
    return date.after(SUMMER_START) and date.before(SUMMER_END)

def summer_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * summerRate

def winter_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge
```

In this code, calculations for summer and winter charges are encapsulated into their own functions, summer_charge and winter_charge, improving readability. The time of year check is abstracted to the is_summer function which improves modularity and makes the calculation of the charge clearer. The main function to calculate the charge, calculate_charge, becomes cleaner and easier to maintain.
