**Refactoring Explanation:**

- **Modularized Discount Logic:** Created abstract `Discount` class and two concrete subclasses `SpecialDeal` and `RegularDeal` to handle different discount scenarios, making the code more extensible and maintainable.
- **Simplified Main Logic:** Moved the discount selection logic from `main()` to a separate function `calculate_total`, reducing the complexity of the main function.
- **Introduced Dependency Injection:** Injected the `Discount` object into `calculate_total` function, making it easy to switch between different discount strategies.
- **Improved Readability and Reusability:** Extracted the email sending logic into a separate `send_email` function, making the code more readable and promoting code reuse.
- **Applied Strategy Pattern:** Implemented the Strategy pattern by using the `Discount` class as a strategy interface, allowing for flexible and dynamic selection of discount strategies. This makes it easy to add or modify discount calculations in the future.
- **Enhanced Testability:** By separating the discount logic into separate classes, testing becomes easier as each discount strategy can be tested independently.
