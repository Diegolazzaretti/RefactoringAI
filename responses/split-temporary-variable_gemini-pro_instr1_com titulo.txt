There are a few ways to refactor the given code to enhance its readability, modularity, and maintainability. One approach is to extract the calculation of the two temporary values into separate functions:

```python
def calculate_perimeter(height, width):
  return 2 * (height + width)

def calculate_area(height, width):
  return height * width

height = 5
width = 3
perimeter = calculate_perimeter(height, width)
area = calculate_area(height, width)

print(perimeter)
print(area)
```

This approach makes the code more readable and maintainable by separating the calculation of the perimeter and area into distinct functions. It also makes it easier to change the way the perimeter and area are calculated in the future.

Another approach is to use a class to encapsulate the calculations:

```python
class Rectangle:
  def __init__(self, height, width):
    self.height = height
    self.width = width

  def calculate_perimeter(self):
    return 2 * (self.height + self.width)

  def calculate_area(self):
    return self.height * self.width

rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)
perimeter = rectangle.calculate_perimeter()
area = rectangle.calculate_area()

print(perimeter)
print(area)
```

This approach is more object-oriented and makes it easier to add new methods to the class in the future. It also makes it easier to reuse the class to calculate the perimeter and area of other rectangles.
