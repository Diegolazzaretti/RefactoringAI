Let's refactor the code applying the Strategy design pattern. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each one of them into a separate class, and make the objects of these classes interchangeable. Therefore, we create the Bird class and multiple classes for different types of Birds having their specific getSpeed() method implementations.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Bird(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def getSpeed(self):
        pass

class EuropeanBird(Bird):
    def getBaseSpeed(self):
        # Implementation of base speed for European bird
        pass

    def getSpeed(self):
        return self.getBaseSpeed()

class AfricanBird(Bird):
    def __init__(self, numberOfCoconuts):
        self.numberOfCoconuts = numberOfCoconuts

    def getBaseSpeed(self):
        # Implementation of base speed for African bird
        pass

    def getLoadFactor(self):
        # Implementation of the load factor for African bird
        pass

    def getSpeed(self):
        return self.getBaseSpeed() - self.getLoadFactor() * self.numberOfCoconuts

class NorwegianBlueBird(Bird):
    def __init__(self, isNailed, voltage):
        self.isNailed = isNailed
        self.voltage = voltage

    def getBaseSpeed(self):
        # Implementation of base speed for Norwegian Blue bird
        pass

    def getSpeed(self):
        return 0 if self.isNailed else self.getBaseSpeed(self.voltage)
```

Changes made:

1. The original Bird class has been turned into an Abstract Base Class (ABC) with the `@abstractmethod` `getSpeed()` which requires all subclasses to provide their implementation.

2. Created separate classes for EuropeanBird, AfricanBird, and NorwegianBlueBird. Each class represents a specific type of bird and its specific `getSpeed()` implementation.

3. Data like `isNailed` and `voltage` specific to types of birds have been made instance variables in their respective classes.

4. Applied the replace-conditional-with-polymorphism refactoring technique to remove the complexity of deciding the bird type to call the appropriate `getSpeed()` method.

5. Each class now handles its own logic and has a clear responsibility within the system, this increases the overall modularity.

Benefits:

1. Improves readability and understandability of code by removing complex and nested conditionals.

2. Easier to extend: when we need to add any new bird type in the system, we simply need to create a new class for that bird.

3. Decreases the chances of error: changes in one bird class are less likely to affect the other bird classes, making the code more maintainable.

4. It is easier to test the functionality of each bird type separately.
