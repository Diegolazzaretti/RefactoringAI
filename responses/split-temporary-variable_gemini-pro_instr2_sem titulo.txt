**Refactored Code**

```python
# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
def calculate_perimeter(height, width):
    perimeter = 2 * (height + width)
    return perimeter

# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(height, width):
    area = height * width
    return area

# Get the height and width of the rectangle from the user
height = int(input("Enter the height of the rectangle: "))
width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle
perimeter = calculate_perimeter(height, width)
area = calculate_area(height, width)

# Print the perimeter and area of the rectangle
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
print("Area:", area)
```

**Explanation**

The original code is not very readable, modular, or maintainable. It calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle in the same function, making it difficult to understand and modify. The refactored code addresses these issues by applying the following improvements:

- **Function Decomposition**: The calculation of perimeter and area is separated into two distinct functions, `calculate_perimeter` and `calculate_area`. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.
- **Variable Scope**: The `temp` variable is replaced with local variables within the functions to avoid naming conflicts and improve code clarity.
- **Input Handling**: The user is prompted to enter the height and width of the rectangle separately, making it easier to understand and avoid potential errors.
- **Meaningful Variable Names**: The variable names are changed to more meaningful ones, such as `perimeter` and `area`.
- **Consistent Formatting**: The code is formatted in a consistent style, making it easier to read and understand.

These changes contribute to the following improvements:

- **Readability**: The refactored code is much easier to read and understand, as the logic is simplified and organized into meaningful functions.
- **Modularity**: The functions can be reused in other parts of the code, making it more flexible and maintainable.
- **Maintainability**: The code is easier to modify and extend, as the functions can be updated independently.

Overall, the refactored code adheres to the best practices of software development and provides a more robust and maintainable solution.
