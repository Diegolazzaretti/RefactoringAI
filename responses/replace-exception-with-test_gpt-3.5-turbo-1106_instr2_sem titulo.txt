The code can be enhanced by introducing a separate class to keep track of specific period values. The Singleton design pattern will be applied to ensure only one instance of the class is created. The refactored code follows:

```python
class PeriodValues:
    _instance = None

    def __init__(self):
        if not PeriodValues._instance:
            self.values = []

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = PeriodValues()
        return cls._instance

    def get_value_for_period(self, period_number):
        try:
            return self.values[period_number]
        except IndexError:
            return 0
```

The refactored code adheres to best practices by separating the period values management into a designated class. The Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of the class exists, making it easy to maintain and safely accessible across the application.

The refactored code enhances modularity and readability, improving the maintainability by encapsulating period value handling. Additionally, error handling is centralized in the `get_value_for_period` method, simplifying the logic and reducing code duplication. The overall organization is more structured, allowing for future modifications to be easily implemented with minimal impact on the remaining code.
