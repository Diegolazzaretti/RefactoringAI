To improve the readability, modularity, and maintainability of the given code, we can make use of inheritance to separate the constructor logic into a separate class, as well as add type hints for better type checking. Here's an example refactored code:
```python
13. pull-up-constructor-body
from typing import Tuple

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name: str, id: int):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name: str, id: int, grade: int) -> None:
        super().__init__(name, id)
        self.grade = grade

    def get_grade(self) -> Tuple[str, int]:
        return f"Manager {self.grade}", self.grade
```
In this refactored code, we define the `Employee` class with a constructor that takes `name` and `id` as arguments. We then define the `Manager` class that inherits from `Employee`. The `__init__` method of `Manager` adds an additional argument `grade`, calls the constructor of `Employee` using `super()`, and sets the `grade` attribute of the instance.

We also added type hints to the `__init__` method of `Manager` for better type checking. The `get_grade` method returns a tuple of the form `(str, int)`.

This refactored code is more modular and maintainable as we separated the constructor logic into a separate class and added type hints for better type checking.
