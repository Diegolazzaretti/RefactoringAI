class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id

class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self, name, id, grade):
        super().__init__(name, id)
        self.grade = grade
# ...

Explanation:
1. Created an Employee class to handle the common attributes of all employees, such as name and id.
2. Refactored the Manager class to inherit from the Employee class, allowing it to reuse the name and id attributes. 
3. Used super() to call the constructor of the Employee class from the Manager class, initializing the name and id attributes. 
4. This approach enhances readability, modularity, and maintainability by promoting code reusability, reducing duplication, and simplifying the logic. It also follows the best practice of using inheritance to model the "is-a" relationship between the Manager and the Employee.
