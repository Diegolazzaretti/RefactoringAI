Refactored Code:

```python
def calculate_discount(inputVal, quantity):
    limit_for_discount = 50
    discount_amount = 2
    
    if is_eligible_for_discount(quantity, limit_for_discount):
        return apply_discount(inputVal, discount_amount)
    return inputVal

def is_eligible_for_discount(quantity, limit_for_discount):
    return quantity > limit_for_discount

def apply_discount(inputVal, discount_amount):
    return inputVal - discount_amount
```

Explanation:

1. Renamed `discount` function to `calculate_discount` to make it more indicative of what the function does.
   
2. Created a constant, `limit_for_discount = 50`, to replace the literal '50' in the `if` condition to make it more readable. Now, without diving into the actual logic, one can understand what that '50' denotes. This also allows for easier modification of this threshold. 

3. Similarly, I replaced the literal '2' with a variable `discount_amount` to enhance readability. 

4. Instead of assigning the result of the discount application back onto `inputVal`, I directly return it. This is in accordance with the principle of not modifying the method parameters— a good practice to avoid side effects and enhance testability.

5. Separated out the discount eligibility check and the actual applying of the discount into separate functions `is_eligible_for_discount` and `apply_discount`. This enhances modularity, testability, and readability of the code. Each function now adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, having just one job to do.

Following software development best practices, this code is much more maintainable, readable and ready for future modifications. Moreover, the logic is simplified, eliminating mutation of input parameters.
