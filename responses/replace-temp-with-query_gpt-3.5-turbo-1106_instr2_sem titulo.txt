class TotalCalculator:
    def __init__(self, quantity, itemPrice):
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.itemPrice = itemPrice

    def calculateTotal(self):
        basePrice = self.quantity * self.itemPrice
        discount_rate = 0.98 if basePrice <= 1000 else 0.95
        return basePrice * discount_rate

# Changes Made:
# Created a TotalCalculator class to encapsulate the functionality of calculating the total
# Encapsulated quantity and itemPrice as instance variables of the TotalCalculator class
# Added a constructor to initialize the instance variables
# Moved the total calculation logic to a method called calculateTotal
# Introduced a discount_rate local variable to hold the values 0.98 and 0.95 based on the basePrice
# Using a single return statement to return the total calculation result, based on the discount_rate
# Improved readability, maintainability, and modularity by separating concerns and encapsulating related functionality within the TotalCalculator class.
