**Refactored Code:**

```python
def find_person(people):
    """Finds and returns the name of a person in a list, or an empty string if not found.

    Args:
        people (list): A list of names.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the person found, or an empty string.
    """

    target_names = ["Don", "John", "Kent"]  # Define the target names

    for name in people:
        if name in target_names:
            return name

    return ""
```

**Enhancements:**

* **Readability:**
    * The code is structured using a Python docstring to clearly explain its purpose and functionality.
    * The variable names are descriptive and follow Python conventions.

* **Modularity:**
    * The target names are defined in a separate list, allowing for easy modification or expansion.

* **Maintainability:**
    * The code is divided into small, cohesive functions, making it easier to maintain and debug.
    * The use of a loop eliminates the need for multiple conditional statements.
