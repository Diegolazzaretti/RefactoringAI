The current version of the code uses deeply nested conditional statements to determine what method should be called based on the status of the instance. This can make it hard to read and understand. We can refactor this into separate return statements with guard clauses which make it clearer what conditions must be met to return each result.

The refactored code could look like this:

```python
def get_pay_amount(self):
    if self.is_dead:
        return dead_amount()

    if self.is_separated:
        return separated_amount()

    if self.is_retired:
        return retired_amount()

    return normal_pay_amount()
```

In the refactored code, I removed the unnecessary nesting and used direct return statements instead, because if a guard clause is met, function execution is immediately halted by the returned statement. The modification makes the code more readable and removes the need for the extra variable `result`. It also allows a viewer to very quickly ascertain the order of conditions being checked simply by checking each line, rather than following a chain of nested condition checks.

Additionally, the Python community has adopted a coding style (PEP8) that recommends lower_case_with_underscores for function and variable names instead of camelCase. I've updated the function and variable names to be PEP8 compliant. This style consistency is also beneficial for readability and maintainability.

The other aspect that should be addressed: functions `dead_amount()`, `separated_amount()`, `retired_amount()`, `normal_pay_amount()`. They should be either previously defined global-scope functions, or they should be instance methods (i.e., `self.dead_amount()`, `self.separated_amount()`, etc.), or class methods. This will affect how they are called within the `get_pay_amount()` method. Without more context, I cannot specifically address this in the refactoring.
