Here's the refactored code:

```python
def calculate_charge(quantity, rate, service_charge=0):
    return quantity * rate + service_charge

def determine_rate_and_charge(date, quantity):
    is_summer = not date.before(SUMMER_START) and not date.after(SUMMER_END)

    if is_summer:
        return calculate_charge(quantity, summerRate)
    else:
        return calculate_charge(quantity, winterRate, winterServiceCharge)
```

Explanation:

1. Encapsulation: The logic for calculating charge is encapsulated within a new function, `calculate_charge()`. This makes the code more modular, improves readability, and reduces redundancy.

2. Single Responsibility Principle: By creating separate functions `calculate_charge()` and `determine_rate_and_charge()`, we ensure that each function has a single responsibility. As a result, the functions become easier to understand, test, and maintain.

3. Descriptive variable and function names: The boolean variable `is_summer` and other function names are chosen to accurately describe what they represent/do, which enhances readability and understanding of the code.

4. Use of constants: The `SUMMER_START` and `SUMMER_END` are assumed to be constants, and adhering to convention, are typed in all upper case. This clearly indicates that these values are constant and not to be modified.

5. Pass additional parameters when necessary (`service_charge`): The need for a service charge is not universal to all charges. By making `service_charge` a default argument in `calculate_charge()`, we maintain the integrity of the code when called with two arguments, while allowing for the option to include the service charge when necessary.

6. Improved Logic: The `is_summer` check is used instead of two separate checks in the original `if` condition, making it more obvious to understand what condition is being tested.

7. Predictable return: `determine_rate_and_charge()` now returns the calculated charge directly, regardless of the time of year. This maintains a consistent return style for the function, which makes it easier to work with in the rest of the program.
