class Payment:
    def __init__(self, name, amount):
        self.name = name
        self.amount = amount

    def print_owing(self):
        self.print_banner()
        self.print_details()

    def print_banner(self):
        # Print banner details
        pass

    def print_details(self):
        # Print details
        print("name:", self.name)
        print("amount:", self.get_outstanding())

    def get_outstanding(self):
        # Calculate and return outstanding amount
        return self.amount

# Changes made:
# 1. Created a Payment class with __init__ method to initialize the name and amount attributes.
# 2. The print_owing method now calls print_banner and print_details methods for enhanced modularity and readability.
# 3. Separated the logic for printing the banner and details into their respective methods to improve organization and maintainability.
# 4. Created a get_outstanding method to calculate and return the outstanding amount, reducing code duplication and simplifying logic.
