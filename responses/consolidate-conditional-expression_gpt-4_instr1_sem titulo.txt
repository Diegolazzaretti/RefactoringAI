gpt-4 - Instrução 1 sem titulo:

Here is a refactored version of the code. I extracted the condition checks into separate functions with descriptive names.

```python
def isEligibleForDisability(seniority, monthsDisabled, isPartTime):
    return hasRequiredSeniority(seniority) and not isExcessivelyDisabled(monthsDisabled) and not isPartTimeWorker(isPartTime)

def hasRequiredSeniority(seniority):
    return seniority >= 2

def isExcessivelyDisabled(monthsDisabled):
    return monthsDisabled > 12

def isPartTimeWorker(isPartTime):
    return isPartTime

def computeDisabilityAmount():
    if isEligibleForDisability():
        # Compute the disability amount.
        # ...
    else:
        return 0
``` 

Please note, to successfully run this new refactored code, you'll need to properly pass the parameters (`seniority`, `monthsDisabled`, `isPartTime`) to the `isEligibleForDisability()` function call, and to the `computeDisabilityAmount()` function itself if needed based on the desired use in project.
