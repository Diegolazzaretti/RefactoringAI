Refactored code:

```python
# We should create two helper functions to improve readability and maintainability

def _isMacPlatform(self):
    # case insensitive inclusion check for "MAC"
    return "MAC" in self.platform.upper()

def _isIEBrowser(self):
    # case insensitive inclusion check for "IE"
    return "IE" in self.browser.upper()

def renderBanner(self):
    isMacPlatform = self._isMacPlatform()
    isIEBrowser = self._isIEBrowser()
    
    if isMacPlatform and isIEBrowser and self.wasInitialized() and self.resize > 0:
        # do something
        pass
```

Changes Explanation:

1. Created two helper methods, `_isMacPlatform` and `_isIEBrowser`, to abstract the logic of evaluating the platform and browser used. Hiding the internals of these credential checks leads to enhanced readability and maintainability because if the logic of these checks were to change in the future (for instance, how we determine if a platform is a Mac or a browser is IE), we would only need to modify the dedicated functions, rather than tracing the intricate logic inside the main method. This modification respects the design principle of 'Single Responsibility' - individual functions should focus on a single task.

2. Removed the usage of `str.indexOf("substr") > -1` to `"substr" in str` for string inclusion check. Python supports direct membership check for strings and this is more idiomatic and readable in Python.

3. Stored the boolean values of `isMacPlatform` and `isIEBrowser` into variables before the main `if` condition. This results in increased readability as it minimizes the cognitive load required to understand the complex condition.

4. Kept the main function's name `renderBanner` same to avoid any functional difference. Ensuring that the external interface remains unchanged is essential while refactoring as it contributes to preserving functional integrity.

5. One potential future improvement would be if the checks become even more complex, we could consider using a strategy pattern. Each validation strategy could be a standalone function or object, further enhancing code organization, readability, and maintainability.
