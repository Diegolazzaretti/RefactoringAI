```python
class TeamRow:
    def __init__(self, team_name, points):
        self.team_name = team_name
        self.points = points

row = TeamRow("Liverpool", 15)
```

**Changes Made:**

* Introduced a `TeamRow` class to represent a row of team data, encapsulating the team name and points.
* Created a new instance of `TeamRow` to replace the list-based row.

**Improvements:**

* **Enhanced Readability and Modularity:** The use of a class makes the code more structured and easier to understand. It separates the data structure (row) from the operations performed on it.
* **Simplified Logic:** The constructor of `TeamRow` initializes the row with the given values, eliminating the need for explicit assignment as in the original code.
* **Improved Maintainability:** Any future modifications to the row structure or operations can be easily done within the `TeamRow` class, without affecting other parts of the code.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The use of a class follows object-oriented programming principles and promotes data encapsulation and code reuse.
