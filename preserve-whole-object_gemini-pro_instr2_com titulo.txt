**Refactored Code:**

```java
public class TemperatureAnalyzer {

    private TemperatureRange daysTempRange;
    private TemperaturePlan plan;

    public TemperatureAnalyzer(TemperatureRange daysTempRange, TemperaturePlan plan) {
        this.daysTempRange = daysTempRange;
        this.plan = plan;
    }

    public boolean isWithinPlan() {
        return plan.isWithinRange(daysTempRange.getLow(), daysTempRange.getHigh());
    }
}
```

**Changes Made:**

* **Extract TemperatureRange and TemperaturePlan classes:** This improves modularity by separating the temperature range and plan concepts into reusable classes.
* **Introduce a TemperatureAnalyzer class:** This creates a central point of control for analyzing the temperature range against the plan.
* **Extract a `withinRange` method from TemperaturePlan:** This eliminates code duplication by encapsulating the logic for checking if a temperature is within a range.
* **Use constructor injection for TemperatureAnalyzer:** This provides a clear and consistent way to initialize the dependencies.
* **Rename variables for clarity:** The `low` and `high` variables are renamed to `getLow()` and `getHigh()` to match the getters in the TemperatureRange class.
* **Return a boolean from `isWithinPlan` method:** This provides a clearer indication of whether the temperature is within the plan.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Improved Readability:** The code is now more concise and organized, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Enhanced Modularity:** The extraction of classes and methods reduces code duplication and improves reusability.
* **Simplified Logic:** The `isWithinPlan` method now cleanly encapsulates the logic for checking the temperature range.
* **Increased Maintainability:** The refactored code is easier to modify and extend in the future, as the responsibilities are clearly separated.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The code follows best practices such as dependency injection and clear method naming, ensuring a high level of software quality.
