gpt-4 - Instrução 1 com titulo:

Refactoring the code:

```python
def calculate_discount(input_val, quantity):
    return input_val - 2 if is_quantity_greater_than_50(quantity) else input_val

def is_quantity_greater_than_50(quantity):
    return quantity > 50
```

Here, the code was refactored to make it more readable by creating clear function names: `calculate_discount` and `is_quantity_greater_than_50`. This way, it's more clear what each function is doing and hence make it more maintainable. Also, instead of modifying the input parameter `input_val` directly, we return a new value based on the condition. This provides better modularity and readability to the code.
