Here's the refactored code:

```python
class Product:

    def __init__(self, quantity, itemPrice):
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.itemPrice = itemPrice

    def calculate_basePrice(self):
        return self.quantity * self.itemPrice

    def calculate_finalPrice(self):
        basePrice = self.calculate_basePrice()
        seasonalDiscount = self.get_seasonalDiscount()
        fees = self.get_fees()
        return self.calculate_discountedPrice(basePrice, seasonalDiscount, fees)

    def get_seasonalDiscount(self):
        # code to get seasonal discount
        pass

    def get_fees(self):
        # code to get fees
        pass

    def calculate_discountedPrice(self, basePrice, seasonalDiscount, fees):
        # code to calculate discounted price 
        pass
```
In this refactoring, code is divided into smaller meaningful methods to improve readability. It also makes sure that each function has a single responsibility which ensures the code is modular and maintainable.
- I moved all the related code and data (quantity and itemPrice) into a Product class to encapsulate related data and behavior into a single object.
- calculate_FinalPrice method orchestrates the calculation by calling the necessary methods in the right order. Making it more readable.
- Other methods like calculate_basePrice, get_seasonalDiscount, get_fees and calculate_discountedPrice are specific to a single task. Thus the overall logic of the code is easier to understand.
- If any changes are needed in the future, we only need to update the corresponding method. The rest of the code would not be affected which makes it more maintainable.
