class Report:
    # ...
    def sendReport(self):
        nextDay = self.get_next_day()
        # ...

    def get_next_day(self):
        return Date(self.get_next_year(), self.get_next_month(), self.next_day_in_month())

    def get_next_year(self):
        return self.previousEnd.getYear()

    def get_next_month(self):
        return self.previousEnd.getMonth()

    def next_day_in_month(self):
        return self.previousEnd.getDate() + 1
The refactored code made the sendReport method much more readable and modular by breaking down the logic into separate methods to handle specific functionalities. By using these methods, the code is easier to read, and each part of the logic is handled separately, making it easy to maintain and extend. The use of appropriate method names further enhances readability and maintainability. Additionally, the refactored code eliminates code duplication and simplifies the logic, contributing to the better overall organization of the code. The introduction of method names adheres to best practices of software development, making the code more manageable and facilitating future modifications while maintaining functional integrity.
