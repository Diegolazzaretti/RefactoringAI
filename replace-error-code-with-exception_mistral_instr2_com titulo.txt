Here's a refactored version of the code that follows best practices of software development to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
        return 0
```
In this refactored code, we've created a class `BankAccount` that encapsulates the balance and the logic for withdrawing money. The `withdraw()` method now raises a `ValueError` exception if there are insufficient funds, instead of returning -1. This makes the code more readable and expressive, as it clearly communicates what went wrong in case of an error.

We've also removed the duplication of logic that checked if the amount to withdraw was greater than the balance, since this check is now encapsulated within the `BankAccount` class. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as any changes to the logic or behavior of the class can be made in one place.

Overall, this refactored code adheres to best practices by following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and encapsulating related functionality within a single class. This makes it easier to understand and modify the code in the future.
