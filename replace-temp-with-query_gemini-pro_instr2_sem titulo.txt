def calculate_total(quantity: int, item_price: int) -> float:
    """Calculates the total price of an item based on quantity and price.

    Applies a discount based on the volume of the order.

    Args:
        quantity: The number of items purchased.
        item_price: The price of each item.

    Returns:
        The total price of the order, after applying any discounts.
    """
    base_price = quantity * item_price

    if base_price > 1000:

    return base_price * discount_rate
```

**Changes made to the code:**

* **Moved the discount logic into an enum class:** This makes it easier to manage and maintain the different discount rates.
* **Created a separate function to calculate the total:** This improves modularity and makes the code easier to read and understand.
* **Added type hints to the function parameters and return value:** This provides better documentation and helps to prevent errors.
* **Renamed the `basePrice` variable to `base_price`:** This follows Python naming conventions and improves readability.

**How these changes contribute to the improvements:**

* **Readability:** The code is now more organized and easier to read. The use of an enum class for the discount rates makes it clear how the discounts are applied.
* **Modularity:** The code is now more modular, with the discount logic separated into a separate function. This makes it easier to modify the discount rates in the future.
* **Maintainability:** The code is now more maintainable, with the use of type hints and a consistent naming convention. This makes it easier to make changes to the code in the future without introducing errors.
