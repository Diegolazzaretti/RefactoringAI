Here's the refactored code:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Bird(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_speed(self):
        pass


class EuropeanBird(Bird):
    def get_speed(self):
        return self.get_base_speed()


class AfricanBird(Bird):
    def __init__(self, number_of_coconuts):
        self.number_of_coconuts = number_of_coconuts
 
    def get_speed(self):
        return self.get_base_speed() - self.get_load_factor() * self.number_of_coconuts


class NorwegianBlueBird(Bird):
    def __init__(self, is_nailed, voltage):
        self.is_nailed = is_nailed
        self.voltage = voltage

    def get_speed(self):
        return 0 if self.is_nailed else self.get_base_speed(self.voltage)

```

Explanation:

1. I've introduced an abstract class 'Bird', which has an abstract method 'get_speed'. This allows the definition of a common interface for all bird types.

2. Each bird type is now a separate class extending from the abstract class Bird. This promotes code modularity and organizes the specific functionalities of each bird type into its own class (following the single responsibility principle).

3. The logic to calculate the speed of each bird type is now encapsulated within the corresponding Bird type's class. This applies encapsulation, increasing readability and maintainability.

4. For AfricanBird and NorwegianBlueBird, I've added the constructor methods (__init__) to handle their specific attributes (number_of_coconuts and is_nailed/voltage respectively). This refactoring practice, known as 'Pull Up Field', helps to avoid errors due to the unavailability of some properties in certain subclasses.

5. Adhering to Python's standard naming conventions, I've renamed all methods to lowercase, separated by underscores.

6. The Exception statement has been removed as each bird type is now a separate class and it's unlikely that a scenario will occur where an undefined bird type would call the get_speed method.

By implementing this object-oriented design, we make the code more extensible (additional bird types can be easily added as new classes), maintainable, and readable. It also reduces code duplication and simplifies the logic.
