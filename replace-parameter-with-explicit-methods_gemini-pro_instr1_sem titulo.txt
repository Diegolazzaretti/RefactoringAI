To enhance the readability, modularity, and maintainability of the provided code, it's beneficial to refactor it as follows:

```
def output(self, type):
    output_functions = {
        "banner": self._print_banner,
        "info": self._print_info,
    }
    if type in output_functions:
        output_functions[type]()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid output type: {}".format(type))

def _print_banner(self):
    # Print the banner.
    # ...

def _print_info(self):
    # Print the info.
    # ...
```

In this refactored code:

1. We define a dictionary called `output_functions` that maps output types to their corresponding functions (`_print_banner` and `_print_info`).

2. We check if the given `type` is a valid key in the `output_functions` dictionary. If it is, we call the corresponding function.

3. If the `type` is not a valid key, we raise a `ValueError` with a clear error message.

4. The actual printing logic is moved to separate private functions (`_print_banner` and `_print_info`) for increased modularity and encapsulation.

With these changes, the code becomes more organized, easier to read and understand, and easier to maintain and extend in the future.
