There are several changes that can be made to this code to improve its readability, modularity, and maintainability:

1. Use proper naming conventions for variables and methods, such as using camelCase for class attributes and snake\_case for method names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.
2. Use descriptive variable names that accurately reflect their purpose. For example, instead of "self.health", we can use "health" or "maxHealth".
3. Use separate methods for different actions, such as "attack" and "getDamage". This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
4. Remove any unnecessary comments from the code, as they can detract from its readability and add to clutter.
5. Add appropriate documentation to the code using docstrings. This will help future developers understand how to use the code correctly and make modifications if necessary.

With these changes in mind, here is the refactored code:
```python
class Soldier:
    """
    Represents a soldier in a battle.
    """

    def __init__(self, max_health):
        """
        Initializes a new soldier with the given maximum health.
        
        :param max_health: An integer representing the maximum health of the soldier.
        """
        self.max_health = max_health
        self.health = max_health
        self.weapon_status = 0

    def attack(self):
        """
        Attacks an enemy and does damage to their health.
        
        :return: The amount of damage done to the enemy's health.
        """
        # ... implementation details ...
        pass

    def get_damage(self, enemy):
        """
        Returns the amount of damage done to this soldier by the given enemy.
        
        :param enemy: The enemy that attacked this soldier.
        :return: The amount of damage done to this soldier's health.
        """
        # ... implementation details ...
        pass
```
In this refactored code, we have used proper naming conventions for variables and methods, and descriptive variable names that accurately reflect their purpose. We have also added separate methods for different actions, and removed any unnecessary comments from the code. Additionally, we have added docstrings to provide documentation for each method.

These changes will make the code more readable, modular, and maintainable, which will help future developers understand how to use it correctly and make modifications if necessary.
