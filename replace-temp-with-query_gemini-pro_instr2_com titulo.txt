**Refactored Code with Design Pattern and Improved Readability:**

```python
class DiscountCalculator:
    def __init__(self, base_price, quantity, item_price):
        self.base_price = base_price
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.item_price = item_price

    def calculate_discounted_price(self):
        self.calculate_base_price()
        if self.base_price > 1000:
            return self.base_price * 0.95
        else:
            return self.base_price * 0.98

    def calculate_base_price(self):
        self.base_price = self.quantity * self.item_price


def calculate_total(quantity, item_price):
    calculator = DiscountCalculator(0, quantity, item_price)
    return calculator.calculate_discounted_price()
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Design Pattern:** Introduced the `DiscountCalculator` class to encapsulate the calculation logic and separate it from the client code.
* **Modularity:** Created a distinct method (`calculate_base_price`) to handle the calculation of the base price. This allows for easier modification and avoids code duplication.
* **Readability:** Improved the naming of variables and methods to enhance clarity.
* **Maintainability:** By separating the calculation logic into a class, future modifications can be isolated and easily implemented.
* **Functional Integrity:** The core functionality of the code remains unchanged, ensuring that the refactoring does not introduce any unintended behavior.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Improved Encapsulation:** The use of a class encapsulates the calculation logic, making it more reusable and easier to modify.
* **Enhanced Separation of Concerns:** Separating the base price calculation into a separate method clarifies the code structure and reduces duplication.
* **Increased Maintainability:** Refactoring into a class-based design makes it simpler to update the discount logic or add additional discounts in the future.
* **Improved Readability:** The clear naming and modularization enhance the code's understandability for maintainers and reviewers.
