The refactored code utilizes the if-else conditional statement to check for the presence of the periodNumber in the values array and return the value or 0 accordingly.

def getValueForPeriod(periodNumber):
    if periodNumber < len(values):
        return values[periodNumber]
    else:
        return 0

Refactoring Changes:
1. Replaced the try-except block with an if-else conditional statement to check for the existence of the periodNumber within the values array.
2. By using an if-else statement, we eliminate the need for an exception to handle a missing index, making the logic more explicit and easier to understand.
3. The refactored code improves readability and maintainability by clearly stating the logic for handling missing index values.
4. The refactored code allows for easier future modifications by simplifying the exception handling logic, making it less error-prone and more reusable in different scenarios.
