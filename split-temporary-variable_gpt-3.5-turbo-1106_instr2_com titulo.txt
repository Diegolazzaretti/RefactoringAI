The code can be refactored using the Extract Method design pattern to create separate methods for calculating the area and the perimeter of a rectangle. Additionally, we can use meaningful variable names to improve readability.

Refactored code:

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, height, width):
        self.height = height
        self.width = width

    def calculate_perimeter(self):
        perimeter = 2 * (self.height + self.width)
        return perimeter

    def calculate_area(self):
        area = self.height * self.width
        return area

rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)
print(rectangle.calculate_perimeter())
print(rectangle.calculate_area())
```

Changes made:
1. Created a Rectangle class to encapsulate the logic for calculating the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
2. Used meaningful variable names (height, width) within the class to improve readability.
3. Extracted the calculations into separate methods, calculate_perimeter() and calculate_area(), to improve modularity and maintainability.
4. Instantiated a Rectangle object and called the calculate_perimeter() and calculate_area() methods to demonstrate the functionality.
