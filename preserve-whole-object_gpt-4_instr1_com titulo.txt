Refactored Code:

```python
def is_within_temperature_plan(days_temp_range, plan):
    low_temp = days_temp_range.getLow()
    high_temp = days_temp_range.getHigh()
    within_plan = plan.withinRange(low_temp, high_temp)
    
    return within_plan
```
In the refactored code, the sequence of steps is encapsulated within a function, making the code more modular and easier to read and maintain. An appropriate function name `is_within_temperature_plan` and variable names `low_temp`, `high_temp` and `within_plan` add to the readability and understanding of the code. This function can also be easily re-used for different temperature ranges and plans.
