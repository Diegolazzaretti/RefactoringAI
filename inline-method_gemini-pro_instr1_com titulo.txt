**Refactored Code:**

**1. Extract the calculation logic into a separate method:**

```python
class PizzaDelivery:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...

    def getRating(self):
        return self._calculateRating()

    def _calculateRating(self):
        return 2 if self.numberOfLateDeliveries > 5 else 1
```

**2. Use a lambda expression to simplify the condition:**

```python
def _calculateRating(self):
    return 2 if self.numberOfLateDeliveries > 5 else 1
```

**3. Rename the method for clarity:**

```python
def calculateRating(self):
    return 2 if self.numberOfLateDeliveries > 5 else 1
```

**Benefits of the refactor:**

* **Enhanced readability:** The code is now more concise and easier to understand.
* **Improved modularity:** The rating calculation logic is now encapsulated in a separate method.
* **Increased maintainability:** Changes to the rating calculation can be easily made by modifying the `calculateRating` method.
