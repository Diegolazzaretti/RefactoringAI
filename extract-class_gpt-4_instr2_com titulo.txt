Refactored Code:
```python
class Soldier:
    def __init__(self, health, damage):
        self.health = health
        self.damage = damage
        self.weapon = Weapon()

    def get_damage(self):
        return self.damage

    def attack(self, enemy_soldier):
        if self.weapon.is_functioning():
            enemy_soldier.health -= self.get_damage()

    def is_alive(self):
        return self.health > 0


class Weapon:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status = 0

    def is_functioning(self):
        return self.status != 0
```
Explaination:
1. I applied the `Extract Class` refactoring technique and moved the `weaponStatus` attribute to a separate `Weapon` class and added the `is_functioning()` method to it. This adheres to the `Single Responsibility Principle` of the `SOLID Principles`.

2. The code convention is improved (using `snake_case` for function and variable names because it is more Pythonic).

3. I added an `is_alive()` method to `Soldier`. This method enhances the readability when you want to check if a Soldier instance is still alive.

4. The `attack` method is improved. Now it decreases the health of the enemy soldier (this is assumed from the poorly defined initial `attack` method), but only if the soldier's weapon is functioning.

5. Initializer/methods for setting the health and damage attributes of the Soldier and the status of the Weapon can be included as per requirements. Here, they are initialized through the `__init__` method.

Overall, this refactoring emphasizes object-oriented design (encapsulation of the `Weapon` state and behavior, interaction between `Soldier` and `Weapon`). The readability is enhanced and the code maintains its functional integrity. It is more maintainable and flexible for future modifications (like adding more methods or attributes to `Weapon`, `Soldier`, etc.).
