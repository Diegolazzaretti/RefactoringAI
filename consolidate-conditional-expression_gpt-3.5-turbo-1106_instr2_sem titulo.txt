We make use of Function Refactoring to refactor the code and improve its readability, modularity, and maintainability. 

```python
def disabilityAmount():
    if is_not_eligible_for_disability():
        return 0

    return compute_disability_amount()

def is_not_eligible_for_disability():
    return seniority < 2 or monthsDisabled > 12 or isPartTime

def compute_disability_amount():
    # Logic to compute the disability amount
```

In the refactored code, we have improved the readability by breaking down the `disabilityAmount` function into two separate functions - `is_not_eligible_for_disability` and `compute_disability_amount`. This helps in increasing modularity by separating out the different concerns. This also makes the code more maintainable as each function now has a single responsibility, is easier to test and can be modified independently.

We have also introduced a guard clause method `is_not_eligible_for_disability` which checks if the person is eligible for disability based on `seniority`, `monthsDisabled` and `isPartTime`. This reduces code duplication by removing multiple if statements and simplifies the logic, making it easier to read and understand. This also allows for future modification of the eligibility criteria in a single place, thus maintaining the functional integrity of the code.
