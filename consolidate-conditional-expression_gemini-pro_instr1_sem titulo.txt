**Refactored Code:**

```python
def calculate_disability_amount():
    """Calculates the amount of disability compensation."""

    # Check eligibility criteria
    if not is_eligible():
        return 0

    # Compute the disability amount
    # ...

def is_eligible():
    """Checks if an employee is eligible for disability compensation."""
    return seniority >= 2 and monthsDisabled <= 12 and not isPartTime
```

**Explanation:**

* **Modularity:** The calculation of the disability amount and the eligibility check are now separate functions, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
* **Readability:** The code is now more readable due to the use of descriptive function names and a clear separation of concerns.
* **Maintainability:** The eligibility check is now a standalone function, making it easier to update or modify in the future without affecting the rest of the code.
