First, create a class called RateCalculator that can generate charges based on dates and quantity. This class will contain methods to calculate charges based on winter and summer rates. Create private constants for SUMMER_START and SUMMER_END to represent the start and end dates of the summer period.

```
public class RateCalculator {
    private static final Date SUMMER_START = ...; // Define start date
    private static final Date SUMMER_END = ...; // Define end date
    private double winterRate;
    private double summerRate;
    private double winterServiceCharge;
    
    public RateCalculator(double winterRate, double summerRate, double winterServiceCharge) {
        this.winterRate = winterRate;
        this.summerRate = summerRate;
        this.winterServiceCharge = winterServiceCharge;
    }
    
    public double calculateCharge(Date date, int quantity) {
        if (isSummer(date)) {
            return calculateSummerCharge(quantity);
        } else {
            return calculateWinterCharge(quantity);
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isSummer(Date date) {
        return !date.before(SUMMER_START) && !date.after(SUMMER_END);
    }
    
    private double calculateWinterCharge(int quantity) {
        return quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge;
    }
    
    private double calculateSummerCharge(int quantity) {
        return quantity * summerRate;
    }
}
```

With this refactored code, we have created a RateCalculator class that is responsible for generating charges based on dates and quantity. It contains private constants for SUMMER_START and SUMMER_END to represent the start and end dates of the summer period.

The calculateCharge method checks if the date is in the summer period using the isSummer method, and then calls the appropriate method to calculate the charge based on winter or summer rates.

The isSummer method checks if the date is within the summer period based on the defined start and end dates.

The calculateWinterCharge and calculateSummerCharge methods calculate the charges based on winter and summer rates, respectively.

This refactoring enhances readability, modularity, and maintainability by encapsulating the rate calculation logic into a separate class. It reduces code duplication by eliminating the if-else conditions and improves organization by separating the code into smaller, more manageable methods. Additionally, it adheres to the best practices of software development by creating a reusable and extensible class. Future modifications can be easily accommodated by extending the RateCalculator class or modifying the rate calculation logic within its methods.
