Here's how it can be refactored to increase its readability, modularity and maintainability:

```python
def is_eligible_for_discount(order):
    MINIMUM_PRICE_FOR_DISCOUNT = 1000
    base_price = order.get_base_price()
    
    return base_price > MINIMUM_PRICE_FOR_DISCOUNT
```

- The function name `is_eligible_for_discount` clearly indicates the purpose of the function.
- The constant `MINIMUM_PRICE_FOR_DISCOUNT` is properly named and shows its intent.
- Modularity is enhanced by having the order's base price calculation in a separate method (assuming `get_base_price` does that), which can also increase maintainability.
- Constants, such as the minimum price to get a discount, are easy to update as they are defined at the top of the function.
