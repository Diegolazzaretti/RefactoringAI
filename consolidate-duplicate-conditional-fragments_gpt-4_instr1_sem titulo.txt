Refactored code:

```python
def calculate_total(price, discount):
    return price * discount

def process_deal(price, is_special):
    discount = 0.95 if is_special else 0.98
    total = calculate_total(price, discount)
    send()
    return total

total = process_deal(price, isSpecialDeal())
``` 

This refactoring breaks down the original logic into two functions `calculate_total` and `process_deal`.

The calculation of the total is isolated in the `calculate_total` function, making the arithmetic operation more readable and easier to unit test if necessary.

The decision on which discount to apply is done in `process_deal` which then calls `calculate_total` to get the total price. This function also calls `send`.

This refactoring makes the code more maintainable, each function has a single purpose and it is easier to test and understand what each part of the code does. In the end, the value of `total` is obtained by calling `process_deal`.
