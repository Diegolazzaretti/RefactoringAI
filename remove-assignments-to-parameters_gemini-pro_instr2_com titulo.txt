```python
def calculate_discount(input_value: float, quantity: int) -> float:
    """Applies a discount based on the given quantity.

    Args:
        input_value (float): The original value before applying the discount.
        quantity (int): The number of items purchased.

    Returns:
        float: The discounted value.

```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Enhanced Readability:** The function name is changed to `calculate_discount` to better reflect its purpose.
* **Modularized Logic:** The discount calculation is moved to a separate `discount` variable.
* **Improved Maintainability:** The logic for calculating the discount is simplified and encapsulated in an if statement, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Applied Design Patterns:** The `if-else` statement is replaced with an `if` statement with a default value of `0` for `discount`. This follows the Null Object pattern, where the absence of a discount is represented by `None`.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The function uses type hints for input and output parameters, ensuring data type correctness and improving code readability.
