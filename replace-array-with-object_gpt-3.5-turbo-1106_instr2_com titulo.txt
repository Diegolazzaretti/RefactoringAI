There are multiple ways to refactor the code provided depending on the context and requirements. One approach could be to create a class to represent the row data, using object-oriented principles to encapsulate the data and behavior related to the row. In this example, a simple representation of the data is used to store the city and the number, so a basic struct or data class may suffice. Another approach could be to use a key-value map or dictionary to represent the row data.

Here's an example of refactored code using a class to represent the row data:

```python
class RowData:
    def __init__(self, city, number):
        self.city = city
        self.number = number

# Create a new instance of RowData
row = RowData("Liverpool", "15")
```

In this refactored code, a `RowData` class is created to encapsulate the data related to a row. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the object with the city and number. By doing this, the code is more modular, readable, and maintainable. It also adheres to the principle of encapsulation, as the data and behavior related to the row are now contained within the `RowData` class.

Another approach could be to use a key-value map or dictionary to represent the row data:

```python
row = {
    "city": "Liverpool",
    "number": "15"
}
```

Using a dictionary simplifies the code by directly representing the key-value pairs without the need to define a separate class. This makes the code more readable and reduces duplication, as the data is stored in a single data structure. However, this approach lacks the encapsulation and behavior that can be achieved with a class-based solution.

Overall, the key improvements in the refactored code include encapsulating the row data into a separate class or data structure, which enhances readability and maintainability. Additionally, the refactored code reduces duplication and simplifies the logic by using a more appropriate data representation for the row. These changes contribute to the overall improvement in the code's organization, modularity, and maintainability.
