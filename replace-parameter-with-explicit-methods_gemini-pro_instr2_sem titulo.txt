**Refactored Code:**

```python
import enum

class OutputType(enum.Enum):
    BANNER = "banner"
    INFO = "info"

def output(self, output_type: OutputType):
    match output_type:
        case OutputType.BANNER:
            # Print the banner.
            # ...
        case OutputType.INFO:
            # Print the info.
            # ...
```

**Changes:**

* **Enum for Output Types:** Created an `OutputType` enum to represent the possible output types (banner, info). This replaces the lengthy `if` statements, making the code more concise and readable.
* **Match-Case Pattern:** Used the match-case pattern to simplify the output logic. This eliminates the need for multiple `if` statements, making the control flow more evident.
* **Modular Design:** Introduced a separate function for output, encapsulating the output logic. This enhances modularity, allowing the output handling to be managed independently.
* **Improved Readability:** The code is now structured in a clear and intuitive manner, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Enhanced Maintainability:** By using an enum and a centralized output function, the code becomes more flexible and adaptable to future changes or additions of output types.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced Code Duplication:** Removed the repeated `if` statements, simplifying the logic and reducing the potential for errors.
* **Improved Code Organization:** Separated the output handling into a dedicated function, fostering a more structured and manageable codebase.
* **Simplified Logic:** The match-case pattern provides a concise and readable way to handle different output types, making the code easier to comprehend and modify.
* **Enhanced Testability:** The modularized output function facilitates unit testing, allowing independent verification of the output behavior.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** The refactored code adheres to the principles of software design, promoting maintainability, extensibility, and readability.
