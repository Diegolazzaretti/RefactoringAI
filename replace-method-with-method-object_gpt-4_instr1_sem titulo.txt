Refactoring the code involves breaking down the long computation into separate methods, each performing an individual part of the computation. Here is an improved version of your code:

```python
class Order:
    # ...

    def compute_primary_price(self):
        """Compute the primary base price"""
        primaryBasePrice = 0
        # Perform computation specific to primary base price.
        return primaryBasePrice

    def compute_secondary_price(self):
        """Compute the secondary base price"""
        secondaryBasePrice = 0
        # Perform computation specific to secondary base price.
        return secondaryBasePrice

    def compute_tertiary_price(self):
        """Compute the tertiary base price"""
        tertiaryBasePrice = 0
        # Perform computation specific to tertiary base price.
        return tertiaryBasePrice
    
    def price(self):
        primaryBasePrice = self.compute_primary_price()
        secondaryBasePrice = self.compute_secondary_price()
        tertiaryBasePrice = self.compute_tertiary_price()

        # Now that the specific price computations are modularized, the final price can easily be computed. 
        final_price = primaryBasePrice + secondaryBasePrice + tertiaryBasePrice

        return final_price
```
This modularized approach makes the code more readable and maintainable. Each individual computation is separate and can be understood, changed, and tested independently.
